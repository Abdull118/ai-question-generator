Blood cultures reveal gram-positive cocci that are catalase negative and optochin-resistant. Vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. Which physical exam finding would most strongly suggest a systemic embolic complication of this condition?",
            "options": ["A. Petechiae", "B. Splinter hemorrhages", "C. Janeway lesions", "D. Osler nodes", "E. Conjunctival hemorrhage"],

            "question": "A 30-year-old female presents with fever, chills, and dyspnea. She has a history of IV drug use. Blood cultures grow gram-positive cocci that are catalase positive and coagulase positive. Echocardiography reveals large vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of pulmonary complications in this patient?",
            "options": ["A. Embolization of vegetations into the systemic circulation", "B. Release of bacterial endotoxins into the bloodstream", "C. Embolization of vegetations into the pulmonary circulation", "D. Seeding of pulmonary infections via lymphatics", "E. Infiltration of pulmonary tissue by neutrophils"],

            "question": "A 72-year-old male with a history of prosthetic aortic valve replacement presents with fever and signs of sepsis. Blood cultures reveal gram-positive cocci that are catalase positive and coagulase negative. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the infection persists. What is the most likely explanation for the treatment failure?",
            "options": ["A. Methicillin resistance of the organism", "B. Incomplete removal of vegetations", "C. Biofilm formation on the prosthetic valve", "D. Poor perfusion of antibiotics into vegetations", "E. Mutation in bacterial cell wall synthesis"],

Blood cultures grow gram-positive cocci that are catalase negative and bile-esculin positive. Which of the following laboratory findings would most strongly indicate the predisposing condition for the infection?",
            "options": ["A. Positive colonoscopy findings", "B. Elevated ESR and CRP", "C. Anemia with RBC casts in urine", "D. Leukocytosis with left shift", "E. Hyperbilirubinemia with elevated liver enzymes"],
