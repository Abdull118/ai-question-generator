Causes of MILD AST elevation (less than 5 times normal)Liver Pathology•Alcohol-related liver injury•Steatosis/steatohepatitis•CirrhosisHeart, Skeletal Muscle, or Hematological  Pathologies•Cardiac ischemia•Myopathy•Thyroid disease•Strenuous exercise•Hemolysis

Causes of MILD ALT elevation (less than 5 times normal)Hepatic ALT Predominant•Chronic hepatitis C•Chronic hepatitis B•Acute viral hepatitis (A–E, EBV, CMV, HSV)•Steatosis/steatohepatitis•Hemochromatosis•Medications/toxins•Autoimmune hepatitis•Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency•Wilson's disease•Celiac disease

Evaluationof Isolated Mildly Elevated Serum Aminotransferases (< 250 U/L)Step 1•Review possible link to alcohol, medications, herbals, illicit drugs. (i.e., take a good history!)•Screen for Hepatitis B and C.•Screen for non alcohol fatty liver disease.•Screen for hemochromatosis.Step 2•Exclude non hepatic causes such as, muscle or thyroid disorders.•Consider other etiologies based on clinical presentation such as celiac disease or adrenal insufficiency.

Evaluationof Isolated Mildly Elevated Serum Aminotransferases (< 250 U/L)Step 3•Consider autoimmune hepatitis.•Consider Wilson’s disease.•Consider Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.Step 4•If aminotransferases are less than 2-fold, then observe the patient.•If an etiology cannot be determined, then a liver biopsy may be indicated.

Causes of Elevated Serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)Hepatobiliary•Bile duct obstruction•Primary biliary cirrhosis•Primary sclerosing cholangitis•Medications•Infiltrating diseases of the liver•Hepatic metastasis•Hepatitis•Cirrhosis•Benign recurrent cholestasisNon-Hepatic•Bone disease•Pregnancy•Chronic renal failure•Lymphoma and other malignancies•Congestive heart failure•Childhood growth•Infection/inflammation

Evaluation of Elevated BilirubinStep 1•Do a good History & Physical Exam!Step 2Check laboratory studies:•If there is conjugated (direct) bilirubin with abnormal ALP , ALT, AST then get an ultrasound of the RUQ •If there is unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin with normal AP , ALT, AST then do a hemolysis work up and review medicationsStep 3Review imaging (ultrasound):•If dilated ducts, then do an ERCP or MRCP•If no dilated ducts but has abnormal ALT, proceed with work up for abnormal ALT (i.e., review meds, AMA, ERCP/MRCP , and may need liver biopsy)

Diagnostics Studies Used to Evaluate the Liver•Ultrasound (US)•Computerized Tomography (CT) scan•Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HIDA scan)•Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)•Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) •Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram (PTC)•Liver Biopsy

https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm 

HCV Transmission•Direct transmission:•Primarily through large or repeated percutaneous exposures to infected blood•Examples:–Injection drug use (most common in USA)–Receipt of donated blood, blood products & organs (rare in USA since screening started in 1992)–Needlestick injuries in health care settings•Vertical Transmission•E.g., child born to an HCV-infected mother)•Can also be spread infrequently through•Sex with HCV-infected person•Sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, i.e., razors or toothbrushes •Other health care procedures that involve invasive procedure, i.e., injections •usually recognized in context of outbreaks
Both are inefficientmeans of transmission but still need to be considered

Clinical Course of Hepatitis CIf infection is not recognized:–Chronic infection leads to progressive liver disease–Inflammation leads to fibrosis which then leads to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease•Complications of cirrhosis may be seen clinically and include:–portal hypertension–esophageal varices–ascites–encephalopathy•Treatment–Dependent on genotype–Typically, all oral therapy•Prognosis–Over 90% of people infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be cured of their infection, regardless of HCV genotype, with 8–12 weeks of oral therapy https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm#accordion-1-collapse-4

New Nomenclature Introduced in June of 2023
https://www.aasld.org/new-nafld-nomenclature

Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)•Most common chronic liver disease.•Formerly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and prior to that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)•MASLD encompasses patients who have hepatic steatosis and have at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors.AdultsPediatrics1.Obesity 2.Diabetes/pre-diabetes3.Hypertension4.Elevated triglycerides or lipid lowering treatments5.HDL<40 (m) <50 (f) or lipid lowering treatments1.Obesity 2.Diabetes/pre-diabetes3.Hypertension4.Elevated triglycerides (age adjusted) or lipid lowering treatments5.HDL<40 or lipid lowering treatmentshttps://www.aasld.org/new-nafld-nomenclature

Alcohol Associated Hepatitis•Clinical presentation:–Jaundice within 3 months of presentation–Anorexia–Fever (must rule out other causes first)–RUQ or epigastric pain–Abdominal distention–Proximal muscle weakness due to muscle wasting–In severe cases, hepatitis encephalopathy–Labs note moderately elevated transaminases (typically less than 300 int. unit/mL), with an AST to ALT ratio . •Usually seen in persons 40-50 years of age with a history of daily heavy alcohol use (>100g per day) for two or more decades–In USA, a “standard” drink = 14 g of pure alcohol

Alcohol Associated Hepatitis•Short term (< 1 month) mortality rates can be as high as 25-45% in severe alcoholic hepatitis •Risk Factors for increased mortality:–Older age–Prior liver disease–Acute kidney injury–Elevated Bilirubin levels–Elevated INR–Leukocytosis–Alcohol consumption > 120g per day–Infection–Hepatic encephalopathy–Upper GI bleed–Bilirubin to GGT ratio > 1–High hepatic histology scorehttps://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis?search=alcoholic%20hepatitis%20risk%20factors&source=search_result&selectedTitle=2~77&usage_type=default&display_rank=2 

Diagnosis of Alcoholic Associated Hepatitis•Good History & Physical Exam!–This includes screening for alcohol use disorders (e.g., CAGE)–Physical exam findings may include:•Low blood pressure and/or tachycardia•Signs of malnutrition (e.g., dry and scaly skin, hair loss, brittle nails, mouth ulcers, decreased muscle mass and weakness, stunted growth, and mental changes including irritability and confusion)•Tender hepatomegaly or epigastric tenderness•Fever •In patients with advanced or decompensated cirrhosis,–jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy may be seen

Diagnosis of Alcoholic Associated Hepatitis


Alcohol Associated HepatitisClinical Course•Differential diagnosis–Acute viral hepatitis–Cholangitis–NASH–Hepatoma•Complications–Bacterial infections–Upper GI bleeding

Assessing Severity of Alcohol Associated Hepatitis•Several calculators are available to assess the severity of the patient’s alcohol related disease.•These tools are used to counsel patients on their mortality at the time of diagnosis and help guide treatments.•Two examples are:–Maddrey’s Discriminant function•Total bilirubin (mg /dL) + 4.6 x prothrombin (seconds)•DF of 32 signifies severe alcohol hepatitis•Criteria for starting prednisolone–MELD score•Bilirubin, creatinine, and INR•www.unos.org/resources/mels/peldcalculator.asp•Score of 21 sensitivity of 75% specificity of 75% for predicting 90-day mortality
