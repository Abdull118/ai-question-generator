        Malabsorption           Syndromes      Tamie Proscia-Lieto,MD

Objectives•Review normal nutrient absorption•Define Malabsorption syndromes•Define, discuss and compare diarrhea and steatorrhea•Identify and discuss the signs, symptoms and clinical features malabsorption •Identify and discuss the signs, symptoms and clinical presentations of the various deficient nutrients due to malabsorption•Discuss the classification of Malabsorption syndromes•Identify and interpret appropriate laboratory tests used for screening and diagnosis of malabsorption syndromes•Differentiate and discuss the mechanism, diagnosis and  treatment of  different malabsorption diseases

Normal Nutrient Absorption    Requires three steps: 1. Luminal and brush border processing2. Absorption into the intestinal mucosa3. Transport into the  circulation

 Disorders of Absorption•Increased Absorption oHemochromatosisoWilson’s Disease•Diminished AbsorptionoMajority of disorders of absorptionoMalabsorption Syndromes     

Malabsorption Syndromes•Associated with diminished intestinal absorption of one or more dietary nutrients•Global = impaired absorption of almost all nutrients•Partial or Isolated= impaired absorption of specific nutrients. 

Malabsorption SyndromeClinical Presentation: •Diarrhea•Steatorrhea•Weight loss with adequate nutrient intake•Weakness •Vitamin deficiencies•Mineral deficiencies 

Steatorrhea•Abnormal amounts of fat in the feces•An increase in stool  fat excretion > 6% of dietary fat •Caused by one or more defect in digestion and absorption of fat •Most but not all mal- absorption syndromes are associated with steatorrhea

SteatorrheaDiagnosis  of:•Quantitative TestsoGold Standard oTimed, quantitativestool fat determination •Qualitative TestsoSudan III stain is a qualitative test to establish the presence of increase fat in stool oDoes not establish degree of fat malabsorption oBest used as a preliminary screening study

SteatorrheaDiagnosis  of:•Quantitative TestsFalse + if ingesting non-absorbable fat False –if inadequate dietary fat intake •Qualitative TestsoDoes not establish degree of fat malabsorption oBest used as a preliminary screening studyoDoes not differentiate if problem is mucosal, hepatobilliary or pancreatic cause 

Diarrhea   •Diarrhea is frequently associated with and or is a consequence of the diminished absorption of one or more dietary nutrient•The diarrhea may be secondary either to the  intestinal process or the steatorrhea per se

Diarrhea• As a Symptom: oDecrease in stool consistencyoAn increase in stool volumeoIncrease in number of bowel movement oCombination  •As a Sign: oQuantitative increase in stool water or weight of > 200-225 ml or grams per 24 hours ( western type diet)

Diarrhea             Classified as: •Osmotic: diminished absorption of one or more nutrients •Secretory: small and/or large intestinal fluids or electrolyte secretion•Both may be present in the same disorder

          Diarrhea             •A substantial decrease in stool output while fasting is presumptive evidence that the diarrhea is related to malabsorption of a dietary nutrient •The persistence of stool output while fasting indicates that the diarrhea is likely secretory and not due of malabsorption of a dietary nutrient•The observed effects of fasting can be compared with stool electrolyte and osmolality determination

DiarrheaNormal Stool Osmolality=295 milliosmoles/kg  295 = 2 [(Na+) + (K+)] Secretory Diarrhea: Measured stool osmolality – calculated stool osmolality = <50 Secretory DiarrheaHyperosmolar Diarrhea : Measured stool osmolality – calculated stool osmolality is >50Stool Anion Gap = (Na+) – [(Cl-) + (HCO3-)]

Malabsorption•Malabsorption does not always cause diarrhea•Clinical signs of vitamin and mineral deficiency may occur in the absence of diarrhea•Careful history is crucial in guiding further testing to confirm the suspicion of malabsorption

     Specific Conditions

   Disaccharide Deficiency •Lactase deficiency (milk intolerance)-most common •20% in Caucasians and 80% in Non Caucasians after age 3 •Can be asymptomatic or present with abdominal cramping, bloating  and diarrhea  •Osmotic diarrhea- Unabsorbed lactose acts as an osmotic agent  •A self limited lactase deficiency can occur following injury ( viral enteritis) •Normal appearing villi

Disaccharide Deficiency Diagnosis:•History •Breath Hydrogen Test •Lactose Intolerance Test + for lactose deficiency if administration of lactose produces symptoms and serum glucose rises < 20 mg /dl  

Hydrogen Breath Test•Exhaled Hydrogen is normally produced by the bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates. In small intestinal disease or disaccharide deficiency ingested carbohydrates are not absorbed and are metabolized by colonic bacteria increasing exhaled hydrogen•Patient given 1gm/kg body weight lactose orally and exhaled hydrogen is measures. Increase > 20 ppm indicates lactose malabsorption


Pernicious Anemia•Marked decrease in the intestinal absorption of        cobalamin (Vitamin B12 )•Due to  autoantibodies against the gastric parietal cells•Leads to decrease IF (Intrinsic Factor)  •IF needed for absorption of B12 in the small intestine

The combination of

imaging sequences
with MR angiography
and secretin-enhanced
MRCP offers the
possibility of a
comprehensive
examination within a
single diagnostic
modality for evaluation
of the full range of
pancreatic diseases.

Groove pancreatitis

(A) MRCP demonstrates a “double duct" stricture with proximal dilatation
of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct (arrow). Acystic lesion is seen
between the common bile ductand the duodenal wall. (8) Fat-suppressed
TSE T1-weighted image. Unenhanced (C) and delayed gadolinium-
enhanced (D)T1-weighted images, demonstrate diffuse enhancement ofthe
sheetlike mass, which corresponded to fibrotic tissue.

                                 Tropical Sprue•Etiology unknown•Symptoms of malabsorption •Seen in residents of the Tropics and recent visitors to the Tropics•Can affects most of the small bowel •Responds to antibiotics and Folic acid 

         Whipple Disease•Chronic multisystem disease•Onset insidious •Middle aged males in 4thand 5thdecade of life•Etiology is a bacteria called Tropheryma whipplei

Whipple Disease Symptoms include•Diarrhea•Malabsorption•Fever, increased skin pigmentation•Cardiac symptoms•Anemia, Lympahenopathy•Arthalgias and Arthritis•CNS symptoms (optho, Dementia)

   Whipple Disease•Diagnose with biopsy from small intestine or other organ involved •EM reveals PAS Positive macrophages containing bacilli in lamina propria •T. whippleioutsidethe macrophage is  more important indicatory of active disease than presence within the macrophage •RX prolonged antibiotics 

Whipple DiseaseCautions•PAS positive can persist after treatment•Bacilli outside the macrophage can indicate persistent infection•PAS positive macrophage with M. avium in AIDS•Dementia is a very poor sign

Abetalipoproteinemia•Rare: Autosomal Recessive •Onset in first year of life•Absent Chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL•Dietary fat ( including cholesterol and fat soluble vitamins)  is not mobilized because absorptive epithelial cells do not form chylomicrons•Villous absorptive cells are vacuolated but villous architecture remains normal

AbetalipoproteinemiaClinical presentation:•Diarrhea, steatorrhea•Acanthosis of red blood cells•Cerebella ataxia•Atypical retinitis pigmentosaTreatment: Vitamin E 

Intestinal Lymphangiectasia•Characterized by ectasia of the bowel lymphatic system• Lymphatics can rupture  causing leakage of lymph into bowel•Often associated with abnormal lymphatics in extremities

Short Bowel Syndrome•Refers to myriad of clinical problems following resection of varying lengths of the small intestine•Can be result of required surgery : ex. Crohn’s disease•Can be a rare congenital

Short Bowel SyndromeFactors determining both type and degree of symptoms include :•Specific segment resected (jejunum vs. ileum)•Length of the resected segment•Integrity of the ileocecal valve•Whether any large intestine removed•Residual disease in the remaining large or small intestine•Degree of Adaptation of remaining intestine  


                Bacterial Overgrowth•Proliferation of colonic type bacteria within the small intestine •Caused by  oAnatomic stasis oFunctional stasis
