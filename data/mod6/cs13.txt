Objectives•Define intestinal ischemia •Differentiate among ischemic bowel syndromes•Identify clinical presentations•Understand and apply diagnostic workup and treatments•Define angiodysplasia, dieulafoy lesion, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE)•Identify clinical presentations•Understand and apply diagnostic workup and treatments

Reading•Goldman-Cecil Medicine, 25th ed., Chapter 143, “Vascular Diseases of the GI Tract”•UpToDate:  “Overview of Intestinal Ischemia in Adults”, “Angiodysplasia of the GI Tract”•Bates Guide to the Physical Examination•*Cope’s Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen

Topics •Intestinal ischemia–Mesenteric ischemia–Ischemic colitis•Angiodysplasia•Dieulafoy lesion•Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE)

Intestinal Ischemia:  EtiologiesAny process that reduces intestinal perfusion:•Primary = Decreased blood flow–Occlusive or Nonocclusive•Secondary mesenteric ischemia–Extrinsic compression of intestinal arteries or veinsTherefore Primary can result from: •Decreased arterial blood flow (occlusive, nonocclusive)•Venous obstruction

Ischemic Bowel Syndromes•Acute mesenteric ischemia–Divided into 2 subtypes•Occlusive–Arterial embolism or thrombosis, venous thrombosis•Nonocclusive (Acute nonocclusive, noncolonic primary arterial ischemia)–Low flow states leading to systemic hypoperfusion (e.g., heart failure, sepsis, etc)•Chronic mesenteric ischemia•Colonic ischemia/Ischemic colitis

Ischemic Bowel Syndromes•Superior mesenteric embolism•Superior mesenteric thrombosis•Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia•Mesenteric venous thrombosis•Chronic mesenteric ischemia•Ischemic colitis

Incidence•60-70% of intestinal ischemia are acute mesenteric ischemia–Extremely high mortality rate•High clinical index of suspicion–More than half due to arterial embolism•30-40% are chronic mesenteric and colonic ischemia

Risk factors:Mesenteric ischemia•Old age•Predisposed to arterial embolism –E.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, valvular disease, etc.•Occlusive arterial disease–E.g., atherosclerosis, AAA, vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia,etc.•Low flow states–E.g., sepsis, heart failure, dialysis, etc.•Pathologic thromboses–Usually venous; think of “Virchow’s triad”

Risk factors:Ischemic colitis•Aortoiliac procedures•Cardiopulmonary bypass•Myocardial infarction•Hemodialysis•Thrombophilia•Drugs•Extreme exercise•AV fistula

Remember the blood supply to the gut…


More on gut perfusion:•Rich collateral blood supply helps prevent ischemia in the gut–Rapidly enlarge in response to local ischemia•Think occlusive disease…–Extensive surgical resection, vasculitic disorders reduce•However, low flow states (nonocclusive) will affect watershed areas–E.g., Splenic flexure•Gut can compensate up to 12 hrs via collaterals, ↑ O2 extraction–After 12 hrs, irreversible vasoconstriction, even if correct cause–Necrosis in mucosa à transmural; healing leads to strictures 

Intestinal Ischemia•Acute Intestinal Ischemia–Occlusive•Embolism, Thrombosis–Nonocclusive•Low blood flow •Chronic Intestinal Ischemia–Perfusion at rest, ischemia with increased demand (eating)•Ischemic Colitis–Acute ischemia of colon (IMA)

Acute Intestinal Ischemia:  Symptoms•Abdominal pain–Severe, persistent, periumbilical or generalized–*Pain out of proportion to palpation initially•Fever, AMS, distension, n/v, diarrhea, difficulty eating•Leukocytosis, lactic acidosis

Physical Exam•Hypotension, tachycardia•Distension•Increasedàdecreased BS•Diffuse tenderness•Peritoneal signs, localization of pain, rebound, rigidity = late findings•Occult GIB can occur early in disease•Overt bleeding (late finding) suggests SB infarction

Signs and SymptomsChronic intestinal ischemia•Usually > 45 yo•Atherosclerosis–Other typical Sx•Characteristic symptom is epigastric/periumbilical postprandial pain, 1-3 hrs–“intestinal angina”•Fear of eating, limit food intake–Wt loss

Signs and SymptomsIschemic Colitis•Older patient pop•Atherosclerosis–Nonocclusive ischemia•Rapid onset LLQ pain & tenderness•Abdominal cramping•*Mild-Mod. bloody diarrhea–Hematochezia common–Bleeding usually self-limiting

Acute small bowel ischemiaAcute colonic ischemiaAge varies with etiology of ischemia90 percent of patients over age 60 yearsAcute precipitating cause is typicalAcute precipitating cause is rarePatients appear severely illPatients do not appear severely illPain is usually severe, tenderness is not prominent earlyMild abdominal pain, tenderness presentBleeding uncommon until very lateRectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea typicalCT angiography may be considered as the initial diagnostic testColonoscopy is procedure of choice

Diagnosis•Emergent management concurrent with workup–If suspect gangreneàemergent laparotomy–Broad spectrum Abx:  cover Gram (-) and Anaerobes•Translocation gut bacteriaàsepsis–CV stabilization (fluids, respiratory fxn, maintain CO)

Initial lab findings•Leukocytosis•Hemoconcentration•Indicators of necrotic disease:–Amylase, lactate, aminotransferase, LDH, CK, phosphate–BUT neither sensitive nor specific

ImagingAcute and Chronic Intestinal Ischemia•AXR–“Thumbprinting”–Pneumatosis intestinalis –Ileus w/distended loops bowel•CT abdomen/pelvis (no contrast)–Bowel wall thickening, submucosal hemorrhage, stranding, venous thrombosis, pneumatosis, portal venous gas

Imaging•CT Angiography is preferred imaging study–Highest sensitivity & specificity–Narrowing of proximal visceral vessels–“Pruned tree” appearance of distal visceral vascular bed•vasoconstriction•Seen in nonocclusive (low flow)•MR Angiography is less sensitive for peripheral emboli•Mesenteric arteriogram–If CTA non-diagnostic





History, symptoms, and signs suggest intestinal ischemia
(eg, pain out of proportion to physical exam)

Hemodynamically unstable, signs of sepsis

Resuscitate: Intravenous fluid therapy,
remove inciting factors, empiric antibiotic therapy,
consider systemic anticoagulation *

Plain abdominal films

Free air, signs of advanced ischemia
(ie, dead bowel)

No

Abdominal CT
(intravenous contrast) 7

Nondiagnostic, but suspicion for Other etiology

mesenteric ischemia remains high?

Yes
v
Improved and hemodynamically stable, but
persistent symptoms/signs mesenteric ischemia?

Mesenteric arteriogram Laparotomy4
(arterial and venous phase)

Embolic or thrombotic mesenteric arterial occlusion? Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia ® Mesenteric venous thrombosis



DiagnosisIschemic colitis •Diagnosis can be made clinically–Hx, PE, clinical setting•CT can exclude other causes•Colonoscopy confirms Dx–Segmental ischemic changes•Splenic flexure, rectal sigmoid watershed areas

TreatmentAcute Intestinal Ischemia•Restore perfusion rapidly after initial supportive mgmt•Emergent Laparotomy to evaluate bowel viability–Bypass procedure–Bowel resection•Anticoagulation–Contraindications•Further mgmt depends on specific etiology…

TreatmentAcute Intestinal Ischemia•Primary mesenteric arterial embolus–Laparotomy w/embolectomy•Primary mesenteric arterial thrombosis–Surgical revascularization or thrombolysis with stenting•Mesenteric venous thrombosis–AC, venous thrombolysis if persistent•Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia–Remove inciting factor, treat underlying cause, intra-arterial infusion of vasodilator

TreatmentChronic Intestinal Ischemia•Angioplasty and stenting –Endovascular approach preferred–If not available, arterial bypass surgery

TreatmentIschemic Colitis•Supportive–Maintenance of BP and perfusion•Consider empiric broad spectrum antibiotics •Close monitoring for perforation–Bowel resection

Outcomes•Without intervention, acute and chronic intestinal ischemia are both fatal•Prognosis for ischemic colitis is better–Patients will develop collateral circulation over time

Angiodysplasia•Vascular ectasia•Thin-walled, dilated, punctate red vascular structure in mucosa or submucosa of bowel, usually involving adjacent venules, capillaries and arterioles•Common in  colon (esp. R)•Frequency ↑ with age

Proposed mechanism


Associated disorders•Chronic renal failure•Von Willebrand disease•Coagulopathies•Aortic valvular disease

Clinical Presentation•Typically present with occult blood loss•Painless bleeding, occult (guaiac-positive stools, Iron deficiency anemia) or overt (hematochezia, maroon stools, melena, hematemasis)•Spontaneous cessation of bleeding

Diagnosis•Usually diagnosed by endoscopy (EGD, colonoscopy)•Video capsule endoscopy or balloon-assisted enteroscopy if beyond reach of initial UGI/LGI endoscopy•Angiography if recurrent signs of bleeding w/o ID of source via less invasive means 



Treatment•Electro-, Laser- coagulation•Angiography with embolization•Bowel resection (rare)•> 90% incidentalà no treatment needed

Dieulafoy Lesion•Ectatic artery that has eroded through gastric mucosa•Presents as sudden, massive UGIB, recurrent•Dx:  EGD, angiography•Tx: electrocoagulation, sclerotherapy



Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE)•“Watermelon stomach”•A distinct vascular ectasia of distal stomach•Occult bleedingàIron deficiency anemia•Dx:  EGD & biopsy•Tx:  Iron replacement therapy, electrocoagulation or band ligation, blood transfusion, surgical
