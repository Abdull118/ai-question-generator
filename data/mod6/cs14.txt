Prevalence and Incidence of 
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

Colorectal Cancer: The Basics•Affects men and women of all races•Polyp – Grossly visible mass that protrudes from mucosal surface•Most arise in preexisting colonic polyps•Has a long natural history•Progression of several mutations in genes controlling cell growth and DNA repair•Identification and early removal of precursor lesions (polyps) prevents colon cancer

Risk Factors for CRC Development•Age•Prior history of colorectal adenoma or CRC•Family history of CRC•Inflammatory bowel disease•Strep. Bovis endocarditis or septicemia•Environmental factors–High fat, low fiber diet–Beer and ale (esp in rectal cancer)–Selenium deficient–Environmental carcinogens and mutagens (colonic bacteria and charbroiled meats)

AGA Screening Recommendations for Average-Risk Individuals•Offer screening options to men and women aged ≥ 50 years•SCREENING OPTIONS:•Annual FOBT (3 consecutive stool samples)•Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (miss over 50%)•Combined FOBT (yearly) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years)•DCBE every 5 years•Colonoscopy every 10 years•Insufficient evidence for newer testsWinawer S, et al. Gastroenterology. 2003;124:544.

CRC Clinical Manifestations•Clinically silent for years•Early Disease–Most present non-specific symptoms for years–Defecation disorders–Changes in stool consistency–Presence of blood in the stool–Abdominal pain–Discomfort•Advanced Disease–Loss of weight–Loss of appetite–Severe constipation–Ileus–Perforation and peritonitis–Massive bleeding

Colonoscopy: The Gold Standard•Ability to visualize entire colonàhighest detection rate for colonic polyps and cancer•Can perform polypectomy without need for another procedureLimitationsAdvantages•Highest complication rate of all screening modalities (0.3%-0.56%)•Manpower and cost•Potential for missed lesions (6% of advanced adenomas)

Key Messages: Screening•A common malignancy with long asymptomatic phase•High survival rate if detected in early stages•Can prevent by detection & removal of precursor adenomas•All persons 50+ yrs should begin regular screening–High-risk might need screening earlier•”Rather than focusing on which test is best, physicians should ensure that all eligible patients undergo some type of CRC screening by any method available.”

Surveillance Following Surgical Resection of CRC (Average-Risk Patients)•Polyp surveillance guidelines:  colonoscopy 3 years postop, then every 5 years if normal•Earlier colonoscopy should be performed only if indicated, based on history/examination/stool occult blood testing
Winawer S, et al. Gastroenterology. 2003;124:544.

Surveillance in Patients With IBD•Begin surveillance colonoscopy if 8-10 years of symptomatic, extensive disease•Obtain biopsies of strictures and mass lesions other than pseudopolyps•Potentially dysplastic polyps can be removed by polypectomy• Surveillance intervals have not been studied, but 1-2 yearly colonoscopic intervals are common practice• The longer interval might be more cost effective for the first 2 decades of disease

CRC Screening Recommendations for People With a Family History of Cancer or Polyps•One second-degree or any third-degree relatives with colon cancer: Same as average risk (start age 50 years)•One first-degree relative with CRC/adenoma aged < 60 years,•or •Two second-degree relatives with CRC/adenoma:–Start screening at age 40 years. Otherwise same as average risk•Two or more first-degree relatives with CRC,•or •One first-degree relative with CRC/adenoma aged < 60 years–Colonoscopy starting at age 40 or 10 years younger than earliest diagnosis in family.  Repeat every 5 years.

Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)•Caused by germline mutations of the APC gene•Hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps•Near 100% risk of CRC without colectomy•Mean age at diagnosis of colon cancer is 39 years•Large IntestineImage courtesy of John R. Minarcik, MD.Cruz-Correa M, et al. Gastroenterol Clin N Am. 2002;31:537.


Variants of FAP•Gardner’s syndrome-polyposis and extraintestinal benign tumors: osteomas, desmoids and epidermoids cyst.•Attenuated FAP-less aggresive from FAP . •Turcot’s syndrome-polyposis and central nervous system malignancies (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma).

Gardner’s Syndrome•Adenomatous polyps of the large and small intestine•Associated with Desmoids•Ages 8 – 34•Risk of colon cancer 100%•Rectal Bleeding, Abdominal Pain, Bowel Obstruction•APC Gene mutation

Turcot’s SyndromeMismatch repair cancer syndrome•Colorectal Polyposis •Malignant Diseases of the CNS1.Meduloblastomas2.Glioblastomas •APC gene mutation

Features of HNPCC (Lynch Syndrome)•Caused by a mutation in any 1 of 5 mismatch repair (MMR) genes•Autosomal Dominant• 70%-80% lifetime risk of developing CRC•Average age at diagnosis of colon cancer is 44 years

Features of HNPCC (Lynch Syndrome)1.Other cancers might occur: e.g. genitourinary (endometrial, ovarian, ureteral, renal pelvis), gastric, small bowel and pancreatic cancers2.Multiple colon cancers and proximal (right colonic) cancers are more common, compared with cancer in the general population

Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome•Intestinal Hamartomatous Polyposis•Perioral mucocutaneous pigmentation•Average age of diagnosis mid 20s•Autosomal Dominant inheritance•Polyps of the stomach, small intestine and colon•Small bowel intussusception, obstruction and bleeding, rarely malignant


Juvenile Polyposis•Autosomal Dominant inheritance in the context of a family history of J.P .•First individual in the family to have 10 or more hamartomas throughout the GI tract•These hamartomas are histologically distinct from those of Peutz-Jeghers Synd.•10% rate of malignancy•Present with rectal bleeding, anemia, abd. pain,  or intussusception in childhood or early adolescence•Extra-intestinal Symptoms: Pulmonary AVM

Angiodysplasia of the Colon•Most frequent cause of recurrent lower GI bleed in the elderly•After the sixth decade•Manifest as hematochezia, port wine, or occult, frequently chronic & low grade (15% acute massive hemorrhage)•Theories: Associated with Aortic Stenosis?, renal failure?, CREST, and portal hypertension.•Spontaneous cessation of bleeding•Frequently multiple


Angiodysplasia of the Colon •Small, flat, <10mm, with scalloped or frond like edges, visible draining vein.•>50% found in the right colon•Dx: Colonoscopy, Angiography, Tc99m RBC labeled radionuclide scanning, Helical CT angiography•Intermittent nature is limiting factor

Angiodysplasia of the Colon•Tx: Heater Probe, Multipolar Coagulation Devices, Sclerotherapy, Selective Cannulation & Transcatheter embolization, surgical resection•Recurrence: Treatment (Tx) with only observation and transfusion, 50% will bleed again over several years 

Pseudomembranous Colitis•Infectious colitis caused by antibiotic (Clindamycin, Cephalosporin) induced (within 6 weeks) Clostridium difficile (C. diff.) toxin A or B•Days to months of profuse watery diarrhea•Pathognomonic sigmoidoscopy finding: small membranous plaques adherent to the mucosa•Dx: Stool studies for C. diff. toxin. (Both A & B)•Asymptomatic carriers. 


Pseudomembranous Colitis•Hospitalized, institutionalized, antibiotic, immunocompromised, pts.•Can be fatal in elderly, leukocytosis to 30-60,000, Toxic megacolon, high fever, renal failure.•Tx: D/C antibiotic, begin Vancomycin 125 mg. QID or Metronidazole 500 mg. QID for 14 days.  Cholestyramine will bind toxin. Repeated course of antibiotics.•Multiple relapses may require repeated courses of antibiotics
