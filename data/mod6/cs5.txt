Objectives•Define and discuss: cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary colic and cholangitis•Compare and contrast various types of gallstones•Discuss clinical presentation, physical exam findings, appropriate workup of each of the above conditions •Discuss treatment and potential complications of cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary colic and cholangitis•Discuss risk factors, clinical presentation, physical exam findings, work up, and treatment of gall bladder cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer)

Reading•Goldman- Cecil Textbook of Medicine, 25th e, Chapter 155 &196•Bates Guide to Physical examination and History Taking’, 11th edition. Chapter 11

Cholelithiasis•Gallstones•Concretions that form in the biliary tract usually in the gallbladder•Insidious and they may remain asymptomatic for decades•Migration of gallstones may lead to occlusion of the biliary and pancreatic ducts –Biliary colic –Acute cholecystitis–Ascending cholangitis–Acute pancreatitis

Pathophysiology•Gallstone formation occurs when there is a disruption in cholesterol transport from liver into bile coupled with simultaneous secretion of phospholipid & bile salts•Disruption of cholesterol:–bile salt ratio leads to cholesterol precipitation in GB & stone formation•Occlusion of the ducts by sludge & stones produces the complications of gallstone disease.

Types of Gallstones•Cholesterol•Pigment stones•Mixed stones


Cholesterol Gallstones•More than 80% of gallstones •Liver secretes cholesterol, lecithin, bile salts•If the there is too much cholesterol and bile is too concentrated then one forms crystals•Cholesterol load > bile salts•The main factors that determine whether cholesterol gallstones will form are: 1.The amount of cholesterol secreted by liver cells, relative to lecithin and bile salts, and 2.The degree of concentration and extent of stasis of bile in the gallbladder.

Cholesterol Gallstones•Associations:–Obesity–Crohn’s disease•inhibits bile acid recycling in the terminal ileum–Estrogen–Multiparity–Rapid weight loss–Clofibrate•decreases bile acid secretion

Cholesterol Gallstones Imaging •Mostly radiolucent–i.e., can’t be seen on imaging•10-20% opaque due to calcifications


Pigmented Stones•AKA calcium bilirubinate stones•10-20% of gallstones•High levels of bilirubin & calcium tags along to form crystals then stones•Due to oxidation the stones turn black•If bile is colonized with bacteria the stones are brown (radiolucent)–Liver fluke infections

Pigment Stones•Associations–Chronic hemolysis–Alcoholic cirrhosis–Biliary infections–TPN (total parenteral nutrition)

Pigment Gallstone ImagingRadiopaque (seen on radiograph)


Mixed gallstones•Cholesterol gallstones  become colonized with bacteria•Lytic enzymes from the bacteria and leukocytes hydrolyze  the bilirubin and fatty acids•Over time the stones become calcified•Producing a calcium ring around the stone

Risk Factors 4F’s•Female•Fat•Fertile•Forty


HistoryFOUR stages: 1.The lithogenic state•gallstone formation 2.Asymptomatic gallstones 3.Symptomatic gallstones •characterized by episodes of biliary colic4.Complicated cholelithiasis

Asymptomatic Gallstones•Likelihood of developing symptoms or complications is 1-2% per year •Asymptomatic gallstones do not require any treatment.•Coexist with other gastrointestinal conditions–Irritable Bowel Syndrome, GERD–Discovered during an evaluation for nonspecific symptoms are usually innocent bystanders, and treatment directed at the gallstones is unlikely to relieve these symptoms.

Clinical Presentation: Biliary colic•Right Upper Quadrant pain•Radiating to right shoulder•Postprandial (worse after eating)•Triggered by Fatty foods•May have nausea* Gallstones impact in the cystic duct during a gallbladder contraction, increasing gallbladder wall tension. * In most cases, the pain resolves over 30 to 90 minutes as the gallbladder relaxes and the obstruction is relieved

Diagnosis/Workup•Ultrasound: Best test•MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography)•Liver related tests


Treatment of Gallstones•Elective cholecystectomy (removal of GB) in symptomatic patients•Avoidance of fatty food prior to procedure


Complications of Gallbladder Stones1.Acute cholecystitis:–acute inflammation of GB; usually from cholelithiasis (gallstones blocking cystic duct)2.Chronic cholecystitis:–chronic inflammation of GB 3.Choledocholithiasis:–gallstone in common bile duct4.Cholangitis:–bacterial infection of the biliary tree

Complications of Gallbladder Stones5.Acute pancreatitis:–stone impacted at ampulla of vater causing obstruction of pancreatic duct6.Mirizzi syndrome:–stone in cystic duct or neck of Gallbladder causing compression of CBD resulting in obstruction and jaundice7.Cholecystoenteric fistula8.Gallstone ileus:–rare form small bowel obstruction by impaction of gallstone in small bowel (typically due to cholecysto-enteric fistula – GB/small bowel connection

Cholecystoenteric Fistula

Physical•Right upper quadrant tenderness–over gallbladder location•Murphy sign–Palpate right subcostal area (GB fossa) while patient inspires deeply (the GB descends toward examiner’s fingers)–Positive response = disruption of inspiration due to increased discomfort of examiner’s fingers.–Sonographic Murphy sign: when this occurs during US•Fever, tachycardia & hypotension–Can be seen in acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, or acute pancreatitis, in addition to abdominal pain•Jaundice–Obstruction of the common bile duct produces cutaneous & scleral icterus–Charcot Triad: •Indicates cholangitis–RUQ pain–Fever–Jaundice–Reynolds Pentad: •Charcot’s Triad PLUS shock & altered mental status•Acute gallstone pancreatitis is often characterized by epigastric tenderness

Work Up•Uncomplicated cholelithiasis –Normal labs•Acute cholecystitis –Elevated WBC & liver function tests•Choledocholithiasis–Stone in common bile duct•Elevated WBC, transaminases, followed by elevated alkaline phosphatase & bilirubin•If obstruction is at level of ampulla of Vater –may have obstruction of the pancreatic duct & see elevation of lipase & amylase•Ascending Cholangitis–As above with worsening clinical course

Imaging Studies•X-rays:–May see calcified stones or calcified gallbladder (porcelain gallbladder) –May see other complications such as perforation (air)–Used to exclude other etiology of pain•Ultrasound–Most sensitive, specific, noninvasive, inexpensive–*Acute cholecystitis: gallbladder edema and pericholecystic fluid–If choledocholithiasis: CBD dilation


Imaging Studies•CT Scan–More expensive, less sensitive–Better than US for detecting CBD stones•MRI–Most expensive–Great pictures of the biliary tract•HIDA–Technetium-99m (99m Tc) hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scintigraphy–Stone obstruction of the cystic duct will show non-visualization of GB & confirm dx


Imaging Studies•ERCP–Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography–Used to remove the obstructing stone or to diagnosis obstructing tumor•EUS–Endoscopic ultrasound


Treatment Cholecystitis•Antibiotics•Surgery (cholecystectomy)•If choledocholithiasis (stone in CBD); then ERCP indicated

Cholesterolosis of the Gallbladder•Strawberry gallbladder•Changes in the gallbladder due to excess cholesterol or cholesterol gallstone•Typical stippled appearance to the mucosal surface on gross appearance of the gallbladder.


Gallbladder Cancer•5th most common GI cancer in the U.S.•Arises in setting of chronic inflammation•Gallstones increase the risk of GB cancer 4-5 fold•Increase incidence with increasing age  (>70)•Female > Male•Native Indians & Alaskan natives•Mostly Adenocarcinoma•* Porcelain GB: calcified GB due to chronic cholecystitis; treatment = cholecystectomy due to high rates GB carcinoma*


History•Overlap with the symptoms of gallstones & biliary colic •Abdominal pain may be of a more diffuse & persistent nature than the classic right upper quadrant pain of gallstone disease •Jaundice, anorexia, & weight loss often indicate more advanced disease

Physical•Jaundice•Courvoisier sign –Palpable mass in the right upper quadrant–Results from complete obstruction of the cystic duct–Seen in gallbladder cancers & tumors at head of pancreas•Sister Mary Joseph nodes –Periumbilical lymphadenopathy •Virchow node– Left supraclavicular adenopathy•Blumer’s shelf –If pelvic seeding happens a mass can be palpated on digital rectal examination

Work Up•Tumor marker CA 19-9–CA 19-9 may be significantly elevated in both cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer–CA 19-9 can be useful in conjunction with CEA•Liver function tests: –Elevated alkaline phosphatase & bilirubin levels are often found with more advanced disease

Imaging Studies•Ultrasonography (US) –Standard initial study •Computed tomography (CT) scans –Can demonstrate tumor invasion outside of the gallbladder and identify metastatic disease elsewhere in the abdomen or pelvis. •Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) –Has been useful in examining this region for disease extension into other tissues or metastatic disease in the liver. It can provide details of the vasculature for preoperative planning via magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and bile duct passages via magnetic resonance cholangiogram (MRCP).•ERCP–May establish the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer by bile cytology•Endoscopic ultrasonography –Can be useful to assess regional lymphadenopathy and depth of tumor invasion into the wall of the gallbladder. In conjunction with other studies, it also can provide a means of obtaining bile for cytology , which has a sensitivity of 73% for the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer

Treatment•Surgery•Chemotherapy–5-FU based–Gemcitabine- alone or in combination•Adjuvant radiation therapy

Cholangiocarcinoma•Malignancies of the biliary duct system•High mortality•Native Americans•Female>male•Age over 60•Occur in 3 geographic regions:1.Intrahepatic2.Extrahepatic (i.e., perihilar)3.Distal extrahepatic•Perihilar tumors, also called Klatskin tumors occur at the bifurcation of right & left hepatic ducts

Cholangiocarcinoma - Pathophysiology •Mostly adenocarcinoma•Etiology largely unknown•Commonly associated with inflammatory processes:–Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or chronic parasitic infection, ulcerative colitis, chronic cholecystitis

History•Jaundice •Clay-colored stools •Bilirubinuria (dark urine) •Pruritus •Weight loss•Abdominal pain

Causes•Infections:–Clonorchis sinensis, & Opisthorchis viverrini Ascaris lumbricoides•Inflammatory bowel disease:–Primary sclerosing cholangitis•The lifetime risk is 10-20%.–Ulcerative colitis without symptomatic primary sclerosing cholangitis–Crohn’s disease•Chemical exposures:–Primarily in workers in the aircraft, rubber, & wood-finishing industries–Developed years after administration of the radiopaque medium thorium dioxide (i.e., thorotrast).･•Congenital diseases of the biliary tree–Including choledochal cysts &Caroli disease•Other conditions rarely associated with cholangiocarcinoma include:–Bile duct adenomas, biliary papillomatosis, & alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
