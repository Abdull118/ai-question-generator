Reading•Goldman-Cecil Medicine, 26th e, Chapter 129, 859-870.e 1•Pathophysiology, Damjanov, chapter 7

Esophageal SymptomsHeartburn/GERD•Substernal burning•Water brash (acidic taste in mouth) association with food intakeDysphagia•Difficulty swallowingOdynophagia•Pain with swallowingGlobus•Sensation of object in throatMechanical problem•Difficulty swallowing solidsNeuromuscular/Motility Problems•Difficulty swallowing solid and liquids

Work Up of Esophageal Disorders•Start with a good History & physical exam!•Initial diagnosis/diagnoses (What’s your differential?)•Then use the following confirm your diagnosis!•Lab tests•Imaging tests•Procedures•Treatment is based on final diagnosis!

Studies Used to Evaluate the EsophagusBarium EsophogramEndoscopyManometryEsophageal pH testingImaging tests•Evaluate lumen using contrast medium orally ingested•May view via x-ray, or cine-esophogram (video study) for detailed evaluation of swallowing•Direct visualization of lumen and mucosa via fiber optic camera•May perform biopsies, dilation, stenting, hemostasis•Measurement of pressures in the esophagus and LES•Evaluation of peristalsis•24 hour reading of acidity of esophagus exposure•Confirmation of reflux disease•CT scan or endoscopic ultrasound in defining esophageal wall thickening, submucosal lesions, & extent of malignancy


Esophageal Disorders of Motility: AchalasiaAperistalsis•Increase resting LES tone/incomplete relaxation of LES (lower esophageal sphincter)Etiology•Primary:failed migration of ganglion cells to myenteric plexus responsible for relaxation of LES•Secondary:any process that impairs esophageal motilityExamples: •Chagas disease: infection with Trypanosoma cruzi which destroys myenteric plexus of esophagus, duodenum, colon, ureter•Tumor or esophageal cancerSymptoms•Solid food dysphagia progressing to liquid food dysphagia•Chest pain•Weight loss•Regurgitation•Aspiration of undigested food

Disorder of Motility: AchalasiaDiagnosisEsophageal manometry:•Normal or elevated LES•Decreased LES relaxation•AperistalsisBarium swallow:•Dilated esophagus with bird beak narrowingTreatment•Surgery (myotomy)•Balloon dilation•Botox
Achalasia: Barium Swallow

Esophageal Manometry:


Disorders of Function:Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)•Abnormal relaxation of the LES•Allows gastric contents to reflux into esophagus•Symptoms:•Heartburn•Bitter taste in the back of the mouth•Often related to food (spicy, citrus, chocolate, coffee)•Hoarseness or chronic cough

Disorders of Function: GERD•Hiatal hernia may predispose to GERD•Widened crural diaphragm & proximally displaced gastroesophageal junction negating effect of crural diaphragm to increase LES pressure extrinsically


Disorders of Function:GERDDiagnosis:•pH monitoring•Clinical symptoms•Endoscopy that shows mucosal changes consistent with GERD (esophagitis)


Disorders of Function:GERDTreatment:•Lifestyle Modifications•Histamine blockers (e.g., famotidine)•Proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole)•Surgery if above ineffective (e.g., Nissen fundoplication) 


Lifestyle Modifications for GERD Treatment•Maintain upright posture during and after eating. •Smoking cessation.•Avoid tight fitting clothing in the abdominal area. •Avoid eating within 3 hours before bedtime. •Weight loss if overweight.•Elevate the head of bed 4-6 inches.•Avoid chocolate, coffee, alcohol, mint, carbonated beverages, citrus juices, and tomato products.

GERD: Indications for Surgical Management•Patient has failed medical management•inadequate symptom control•severe regurgitation not controlled with acid suppression•medication side effects•The patient opts for surgery despite successful medical management •due to quality-of-life considerations, lifelong need for medication intake, expense of medications, etc.•The patient has complications of GERD •e.g., Barrett's esophagus, peptic stricture

Nissen Fundoplication


GERD Complications
•Peptic stricture•Barrett’s esophagus


Disorders of Esophageal Structure: Diverticula
Saccular outpouchings in esophagus.•False diverticula:•mucosal layers protruding through the muscularis; most common•True diverticula:•contains alllayers of esophageal wall; less common


Disorders of Esophageal Structure: DiverticulaPharyngo-esophageal (Zenker’s)Mid-Esophageal: Epiphrenic Location•Immediately above the cricopharyngeal muscle of the UES•Middle ⅓ of esophagus•Also called “traction” diverticulum•“TRUE” Diverticulum: Contains all layers of the esophageal wall•Distal Esophagus near LESClinical Presentation•Seen in older men•Dysphagia•Regurgitation of undigested food•Halitosis•Associated with TB infection•DysphagiaDiagnosis•Barium Swallow•Barium Swallow•Barium SwallowTreatment•Cricopharyngeal myotomy•Rarely required•Distal esophageal myotomy with diverticulectomy

Zenker’s (hypo-pharyngeal) Diverticulum•Related to incomplete or uncoordinated UES relaxation•Treatment when necessary is cricopharyngeal myotomy
Remember:Older men with dysphagia and halitosis (bad breath!)

Disorders of Esophageal Structure:Boerhaave’ s Syndrome (transmural)•Spontaneous rupture of esophagus, usually associated with increase in intraluminal pressures and rupture of esophageal wall•High mortality•Pneumomediastinum (air in chest cavity)•Surgical emergency


Disorders of Esophageal Structure: Mallory-Weiss tear (not transmural)•Mucosal laceration of gastroesophageal (GE) junction due to vomiting.•Frequent cause of upper GI bleeding, associated with retching & abrupt changes in pressures.•Bleeding usually self limited but may require endoscopic & rarely surgical intervention.•Often seen in people with alcohol abuse disorders & bulimia.


Disorders of Esophageal Structure:Strictures•Commonly related to peptic reflux conditions (e.g., erosive esophagitis, esophageal ulcers)•Can be due to caustic injury (e.g., after alkaline or strong acid ingestion)•Benign vs. Malignant•Benign strictures usually smooth luminal narrowing presenting with progressive dysphagia to solids then solids and liquids•Malignant strictures may be irregular, friable mucosa•Treatment of benign strictures:•dilation of esophageal lumen with bougie or balloon

Disorders of Esophageal Structure:Strictures

Disorders of Esophageal Structure:Rings & Webs•Comprised of mucosal and submucosal tissue•Schatzki’s ring•seen in distal esophagus•intermittent dysphagia to solids•“steakhouse syndrome”•Treatment:•balloon dilation•Cervical webs:•associated with iron deficiency anemia (Plummer-Vinson syndrome)•Diagnosis of ring/web by esophogram or endoscopy

Disorder of Esophageal Structure:Rings & Webs

Disorder of Esophageal Structure:Mucosal DiseaseBarrett’s Esophagus•Replacement of squamous epithelium with intestinal epithelium•Due to chronic GERD•Increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma•Treat GERD with PPI, antacids, surgery, etc. Eosinophilic esophagitis•Infiltration of eosinophils in esophagus in atopic patients•Clinically presents as dysphagia•Treat with PPI and steroidsInflammation (esophagitis), erosions, ulcers•Usually, peptic reflux related•Infectious etiologies include candida, cytomegalovirus, herpes (particularly in immunocompromised host)•Other etiologies include caustic substance ingestion, radiation induced, iatrogenic (“pill esophagitis”- NSAIDS, tetracycline, potassium)•Treat with PPI, Carafate

Barrett Esophagus: Mucosal Resection




Esophageal CarcinomaGeneral•Diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy•Staging by Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) and CT scan.•Treatment is surgical, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stent placement, depending on extent.•Often patients present with advanced disease therefore 5-year survival is about 5%.Types of Esophageal CancerSquamous cell carcinoma•Smoking and alcohol, nitrites, lye exposure, history of achalasia, radiation•Present in upper/middle esophagus•Symptoms: dysphagia/weight loss, odynophagiaAdenocarcinoma•Chronic GERD leading to intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus)•Leading to dysplasia and then cancer•Present in lower esophagus•Symptoms: dysphagia/weight loss, odynophagia

Congenital Disorders of the EsophagusGeneral•Seen in neonatesClinical presentations:•frothing, bubbling at nose & mouth•coughing, cyanosis, respiratory distress exacerbated by feeding,•recurrent pneumonia from aspiration•unable to pass nasogastric tube into stomachDiagnosis:•ImagingTreatment:•SurgeryConditionsTracheoesophageal fistula•connection between lumens of the two systemsEsophageal atresia•nonunion of the proximal and distal esophagus

Congenital Disorders of the Esophagus
Esophageal atresia
Tracheoesophageal fistula

Esophageal Varices
•Engorged & distended veins protruding into esophageal lumen•Caused by portal hypertension•most often secondary to cirrhosis•May cause massive bleeding•High mortality & re-bleeding rate•Prevention of bleeding with nonselective beta blocker to decrease portal pressures or banding

Esophageal Varices: Treatment•Treat acute bleeding with endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy.•IV Octreotide (somatostatin analog) can be used to decrease portal pressures while awaiting endoscopy.•If unable to control bleeding endoscopically consider Transcutaneous Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunting (TIPS)•Creation of a vascular channel from portal to hepatic venous system through hepatic parenchyma
