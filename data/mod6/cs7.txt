Stomach•Gastric Symptoms: •Dyspepsia•Abdominal or epigastric/substernal pain or discomfort1.Ulcer-like dyspepsia•epigastric pain relieved by food or antacids, pain before meals or when hungry2.Dysmotility -like dyspepsia•nausea or vomiting, bloating and distention, anorexia or weight loss, symptoms  aggravated by food or after meals•Bleeding•Hematemesis (vomiting blood)•Melena (passage of dark blood in stool)

Stomach - Testing•Upper GI series: –Evaluate lumen using contrast medium orally ingested•Gastric Scintigraphy (gastric emptying study):–Patient ingests radio-labelled food, then gastric area scanned under gamma camera to assess T1/2 of emptying. •Endoscopy: –Direct visualization of lumen and mucosa via fiberoptic camera.–May perform biopsies, polypectomies, hemostasis.•Imaging tests:–CT or endoscopic ultrasound in defining gastric wall thickening, submucosal lesions, extent of malignancy.

Disorders of FunctionDelayed Gastric Emptying:•Diabetic Gastroparesis:•May be seen in longstanding type I diabetes •Presents with nausea, vomiting, & early satiety •Cause is autonomic neuropathy causing delayed emptying of gastric contents •Diagnosis by gastric emptying study•Treatment •Small frequent meals, low fat intake, low fiber)•Promotility agents (metoclopramide, erythromycin, domperidone•Postoperative Gastric Atony: •5% of patients after gastric surgery

Disorders of FunctionAccelerated Gastric Emptying:•Subsequent to ulcer surgery (vagotomy & pyloroplasty) •“Dumping syndrome”•Rapid emptying of nutrient-rich material into proximal small intestine causes distension and release of gut hormones (serotonin) which contributes to symptoms•Symptoms:•Early satiety nausea & vomiting, sweats, syncope, diarrhea & flushing•Treat by slowing intestinal delivery of nutrients •Diet high in protein & fat & low in carbohydrates with minimal intake of fluid

GastritisGastritis:•Inflammation of the gastric mucosa.•Acute Gastritis:•Disruption of mucosal barrier leading to inflammation•Etiology:•NSAIDS:•Decrease prostaglandin decrease → gastric mucosal protection•ETOH•Cushing ulcers:•Brain Trauma: increased vagal stimulation, increase Ach → increase H production•“Always Cushion the Brain”•Curlingsulcers:•Burns: sloughing gastric mucosa•“Burned by the Curling iron”

Stomach

Normal Gastritis



Chronic Gastritis•Continuous inflammation of gastric mucosa leads to mucosal atrophy & epithelial metaplasia•Type A•Fundus/Body•Type B•Antrum


Diffuse antral gastritis Diffuse corporal atrophic gastritis


GastritisChronic Gastritis:•Autoimmune gastritis (type A gastritis) •First body of stomach:•Fundus/body, spares antrum•Antibodies against acid-producing parietal cells, & intrinsic factor (IF) leading to mucosal atrophy (chronic atrophic gastritis)•Loss of acid production (hypochorhydria)•Loss of IF leads to pernicious anemia. •Uncommon form of gastritis

GastritisChronic Antral Gastritis (type B):•More common•Due to H. pylori Bacteria•Most severe in antrum•Linked with gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma •End result of both A & B is chronic atrophic gastritis

Gastritis •Clinical symptoms:•Abdominal pain, dyspepsia•Diagnosis:•Based on biopsy•H. pylori infection•Biopsy (gram negative rods)•Urease breath test•Stool antigen•Treatment•Antibiotics if H. pylori present•Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole)

Helicobacter pylori•Antral Predominant:•Tend to get Duodenal Ulcers•Diffuse involvement:•Associated with diffuse lymphocytic gastritis•More at risk for gastric adenocarcinoma•Associated with gastric adenocarcinoma & Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma.•Treatment:•Combination antibiotics (clarithromycin + amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI), Bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline, and PPI ) for two weeks.

Disorders of StructurePeptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)•Peptic Ulcer:•Punched-out mucosal defect which penetrates the gastric or intestinal wall deeper than the muscularismucosa. •Erosion:•Mucosal defect not deeper than the muscularis mucosa.



Ulcer in stomach pre and post treatment

Peptic Ulcer Disease•Epidemiology: 8-14% lifetime risk•In US duodenal ulcer 5-10-fold more common than gastric ulcer (GU). •In Japan GU>DU• Risk factors:•Helicobacter pylori infection: major cause of DU•NSAIDS: •Aspirin & other NSAID•*Arterial hypotension (stress ulcer), smoking, steroids

Peptic Ulcer•Gastric Ulcer•25% of all ulcers•H. pylori •NSAIDs•Pain with food•Perforation, bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction•10% risk of malignancy

Peptic Ulcer•Duodenal Ulcer•75% of all ulcers•H. pylori more common•NSAIDs•Pain 2-3 hours after meals•Perforation, bleeding, GOO, pancreatitis•Rarely malignant

Peptic UlcerDiagnosis:•Complications•Gastric/duodenal perforation•Hemorrhage•Lesser curvature (bleeding left gastric artery)•Posterior wall of duodenum (bleeding from gastroduodenal artery)•Clinical•Gnawing burning pain after meals•Epigastric pain, guarding, rebound (rule out perforation)•Melena or hematemesis•Diagnosis•Endoscopy:•need to perform biopsy to differentiate from ulcerated gastric carcinoma•Contrast radiography (can show mucosal defects)

Peptic UlcerTreatment:•Avoid NSAID use•Eradicate Helicobacter pylori•2 antibiotics & PPI•Histamine 2 blocker (H2B) or Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)•Endoscopic:•Control of bleeding, biopsy to rule out malignancy•Surgical

Hernia
Hiatal HerniaParaesophageal hernia

Zollinger Ellison Syndrome (Gastrinoma)Multiple peptic ulcerations in stomach/duodenum from excess gastrin secreted by gastrinoma•Majority found in pancreas but may be found in duodenum and stomach •Causes stimulation of parietal cells to secrete acid resulting in multiple duodenal and gastric ulcers.•Diarrhea due to large volume of gastric acid and malabsorption secondary to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by low pH.•Diagnosis: •*Gastrin level >1000pg/mL, CT scan, Endoscopic Ultrasound, Octreotide scan also helpful•Treatment:•Proton pump inhibitor, surgery

Gastric Tumors•Polyps•Carcinoma•Gastrinoma (Zollinger Ellison [ZE] Syndrome)•Carcinoids•Lymphoma•Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs)

Gastric PolypsBenign mucosal tumors:•Hyperplastic polyps:•80-90% of gastric polyps•Mucosal overgrowth secondary to chronic inflammation•Dilated & cystic gastric pits, lined by bland mucous cells•Adenomatous polyps:•5-10% of gastric polyps•Precursors to gastric carcinomas•Found in older patients with chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Most common malignant neoplasm of the stomach (90%)•2nd most common cancer related death worldwide•Decreasing incidence in US (8/100,000)•Higher incidence in Japan (environmental)•Risk factors:•H pylori, smoking, genetic, nitrosamines, chronic atrophic gastritis (intestinal metaplasia)•Symptoms:•Asymptomatic early, may see similar symptoms as PUD•Late manifestations, anorexia, early satiety, weight loss

Gastric CarcinomaFour basic types:1.Exophyitic•fungating/polypoid2.Superficial spreading•mucosa/submucosa (best prognosis)3.Excavated•ulcerated, penetrating (most common)4.Linitus plastica•diffusely infiltrative •rigid thickened stomach wall- “leather bottle”

Gastric AdenocarcinomaTwo types1.Intestinal•Intestinal metaplasia of gastric mucosal cells•Ulcerative and occur in antrum or lesser curvature•Risks:•high salt diet, nitrates, h pylori, chronic gastritis2.Diffuse•Cells lack normal cohesion•Infiltrating mass in stomach wall•Younger patients, involves all portions of stomach•Linitis plastica (leather bottle appearance of stomach)

Gastric Carcinoma•Diagnosis via endoscopic biopsies•Staging by EUS and CT scan•Treatment:•Depends on depth of penetration and spread. Surgery/Radiation/Chemotherapy•Prognosis:•Early: (mucosa/submucosa) 95% 5-year survival•Advanced: (invasion beyond submucosa) <10% 5-year survi

Gastric Lymphomas•Lymphoid origin most often B-cell type•10% gastric malignancies•Most associated with H. pylori•May be treated with H. pylori eradication if superficial

Gastric Carcinoids•Derived from enterochromaffin-like cells of fundus/body or gastrin-producing cells of antrum.•Small and sometimes multiple, slow growing •May be treated by surveillance, endoscopic removal, or surgery

Gastric Cancer Symptoms•Asymptomatic until metastasis or large growth causing pain, hemorrhage•Upper abdominal pain, early satiety, weight loss, nausea•Spread to adjacent organs•Mets to left supraclavicular node:•Virchow’s node•Hematogenous spread to ovaries•Krukenberg tumor•Sister Mary Joseph Node:•nodule in umbilicus•Leser-Trelat:•multiple outcroppings of seborrheic keratosis



Krukenberg tumor


Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)•Immunohistochemistry demonstrates to be derived from the interstitial cells of Cajal (pacemaker cells) located within muscle layers.•Contain C KIT antigen/ CD 117•Endoscopic Ultrasound helpful in diagnosis•May be treated by surgery or chemotherapy

Ulcerated GIST in stomach pre & post treatment

Disorders of the Duodenum

Duodenal Tumors•Adenomas•Adenocarcinomas•Hamartomatous Polyps•Carcinoid•Lymphoma

Adenoma•Rare in small bowel•Similar in histology to colonic polyps•May occur at ampulla causing obstructive jaundice or bleeding•Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) at increased risk•Remove endoscopically or if unable then surgically

Hamartomatous Polyps•Peutz-Jeghers syndrome•Rare familial disorder in which patients have •Mucocutaneous pigmentation of lips and oral mucosa •Multiple hamartomatous polyps of the GI tract•Non-dysplastic



Carcinoid•Often found incidentally•May present with small bowel obstruction•May present with serotonin mediated carcinoid syndrome (flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain) if metastatic 

Lymphoma•Almost exclusively non-Hodgkin•Peak age of incidence seventh decade•Presentation:•Abdominal pain, weight loss, and small bowel obstruction are common•Increased incidence in celiac sprue•Treatment surgery, +/- chemotherapy
