Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)•Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in north America is 10-15%•Pooled prevalence based on international data is 11%•In general, Females > Males•Ethnicity varied•European Caucasian > Hispanic > African American > Asians•50% of people with irritable bowel syndrome report symptoms beginning before they were aged 35 years•20-50% of gastroenterology referrals relate to this symptom complex•High rate of work absenteeism

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Risk FactorsRace•Crosses all races•Ethnicity variedGender•Western: female >male•Eastern: male > femaleAge•Younger > olderOther Associated Conditions•Fibromyalgia•Chronic fatigue syndrome•Gastroesophageal reflux disease•Functional dyspepsia•Non-cardiac chest pain•Psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depression, anxiety, & somatization) 

Irritable Bowel Syndrome:DefinitionChronic relapsing condition defined by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits with NO increase in mortalityDO NOT CONFUSE with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Irritable Bowel Syndrome:ROME IV Criteria•IBS is defined as:•Recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with two or more of the following criteria:•Related to defecation.•Associated with a change in the frequency of stool.•Associated with a change in the form (appearance) of the stool.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome:IBS Subtypes•Per ROME IV, IBS subtypes are based on predominant bowel habits on the days with abnormal bowel movements1.IBS-D (diarrhea predominant) 2.IBS-C (constipation predominant) 3.IBS-M (“mixed”- diarrhea & constipation)4.IBS-U (“unclassified”- patients who meet diagnostic criteria for IBS but cannot be accurately categorized into one of the other three subtypes)

Pathophysiology of IBSThere are several possible causes:1.Altered GI motility •small & large bowel motility2.Visceral hyperalgesia3.Psychopathology4.Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)5.Post infectious

Pathophysiology of IBS:Altered GI Motility •The myoelectric activity of the colon is composed of background slow waves with superimposed spike potentials. •Colonic dysmotility in irritable bowel syndrome manifests as variations in slow-wave frequency & a blunted, late-peaking, postprandial response of spike potentials.•Small bowel dysmotility •delayed meal transit in patients prone to constipation •accelerated meal transit in patients prone to diarrhea. •Generalized smooth muscle hyper-responsiveness 

Pathophysiology of IBS:Visceral Hyperalgesia•Enhanced perception of normal motility & visceral pain characterizes irritable bowel syndrome.•Patients who are affected describe widened dermatomal distributions of referred pain.•Sensitization of the intestinal afferent nociceptive pathways that synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord provides a unifying mechanism.

Pathophysiology of IBS:Psychopathology•Associations between psychiatric disturbances & irritable bowel syndrome pathogenesis are not clearly defined, but commonly seen.•Patients who seek medical care have a higher incidence of panic disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder, & hypochondriasis than control populations.•An Axis I disorder coincides with the onset of GI symptoms in as many as 77% of patients.•A higher prevalence of physical & sexual abuse has been demonstrated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

Pathophysiology of IBS:Post Infectious•Symptom onset after recent infection•Microscopic inflammation:•Laparoscopic full-thickness jejunal biopsy samples revealed infiltration of lymphocytes into the myenteric plexus & intraepithelial lymphocytes in a subset of patients.•Enteroendocrine cells in post infectious irritable bowel syndrome appear to secrete high levels of serotonin, increasing colonic secretion & possibly leading to diarrhea.

Pathophysiology of IBS:Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)•Mechanism for the symptoms of bloating & distention common to patients with irritable bowel syndrome•Rule out SIBO with lactulose breath testing•If positive treat with antibiotics


Clinical Symptoms of IBSHallmark of IBS is:•Chronic abdominal pain and,•Altered bowel habits

Clinical Symptoms of IBS:Altered Bowel Habits•Constipation variably•Complaints of hard stools of narrow caliber, painful or infrequent defecation, & no relief with  laxatives.•Diarrhea•Usually described as small volumes of loose stool, with evacuation preceded by urgency or frequent defecation.•Postprandial urgency is common•Alternating habits are common•Characteristically, one feature predominates in a single patient, but significant variability exists among patients.

Clinical Symptoms of IBS:Abdominal Pain•Diffuse•No radiation•Sometimes lasts minutes, other times hours•Worse after eating sometimes•Improved with passage of gas or BM

Clinical Symptoms of IBS:Abdominal Distention•Patients frequently report increased amounts of bloating and gas. •Quantitative measurements fail to support this claim.•People with irritable bowel syndrome may manifest increasing abdominal circumference throughout the day•They may also demonstrate intolerance to otherwise normal amounts of abdominal distention.

Clinical Symptoms of IBS:Extraintestinal Symptoms•Dyspepsia•Heartburn•Nausea •Vomiting •Sexual dysfunction •Dyspareunia & poor libido•Urinary frequency & urgency •Symptoms may worsen in the premenstrual period•Fibromyalgia


Clinical Symptoms of IBS:ALARM SYMPTOMSIf a patient presents with any of the following an alternative diagnosis should be considered:•Onset in middle age or older•Acute symptoms (Why? IBS is defined by chronicity)•Progressive symptoms•Nocturnal symptoms•Anorexia or weight loss•Fever•Rectal bleeding•Painless diarrhea•Steatorrhea


Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Work Up•Good History and Physical Exam!•Labs•Imaging studies•Procedures


Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Physical Exam Findings •The patient has an overall healthy appearance.•Some patients may appear tense or anxious.•Vital signs are stable.•Benign abdominal exam.


Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Labs•Complete blood Count (CBC)with differential• Screens for anemia, inflammation, & infection•Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)•Evaluates for metabolic disorders & to rule out dehydration/electrolyte abnormalities in patients with diarrhea•Thyroid function tests•Screen for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism•Serology or small bowel biopsy for celiac disease:•Consider, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Special TestingBased on history and other clinical data, the patient may need to undergo special testing to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms:•Lactose intolerance•Fructose intolerance•SIBO testing•Celiac Disease or Gluten intolerance

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Imaging•Double-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy: •Screen for neoplasm & inflammation if alarm symptoms present•Otherwise not indicated•Gallbladder ultrasonography: •Consider this test if the patient has recurrent dyspepsia or characteristic postprandial pain•Abdominal CT scan•Not typically indicated

Differential Diagnosis
Mayer E. N Engl J Med 2008;358:1692-1699

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Treatment and Management•Strong patient-provider relationship•Reassurance•Teach the patient to acknowledge stressors and to use avoidance techniques•Psychiatric referral if warranted•Treat main symptom•Constipation vs. Diarrhea

Clinical Decision Support Too!/: IBS Treatment

Provider-patient relationship
Education and reassurance
Life-style modifications (exercise, sleep, stress reduction)
Dietary modifications (e.g., fiber, low FODMAP)

Loperamide

Bile acid sequestrant
(e-g., colestipol)

| Osmotic laxatives (e.g... PEG) |

v

FIRST-LINE
(MILD)

Antispasmodics (e-.g., Antispasmodics (e-g.,
hyoscyamine, peppermint oil) hyoscyamine, peppermint oil)

Secretagogues (Linaclotide, Rifaximin
Lubiprostone, Plecanatide, Low-dose TCA (e.g..
Tenapanor) Amitriptyline, Desipramine)

Eluxadoline

If persistent abdominal
pain and/or
psychological
symptoms

Add or switch to low
dose TCA (if not
already taking), SNRI,

THIRD-  SECOND-LINE
(MODERATE)'

LINE*

Brain-Gut Behavior
Therapies (e.g., CBT,
hypnosis)

*Selection of the medication should be based on the clinical features and needs of the patient.

behavioral therapy



Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Treatment and ManagementGeneral Recommendations:•Avoid Carbonated beverages•Avoid Gum chewing•Avoid artificial sweeteners or sugar free food•Charco Caps•Simethicone•IBGard (peppermint oil)

Medications Used in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
Mayer E. N Engl J Med 2008;358:1692-1699

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):Treatment and ManagementNutrition•Diet•Check for history of food allergies & intolerances.•A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) is the best evidence-based diet for IBS.•Gluten-free diet may also be effective but not as much evidence supporting the same. •Collaborate with a registered dietician•Fiber•Insoluble fiber (wheat bran, whole grains, fruit and vegetable skins, and seeds) does not treat IBS, adds bulk to stool•Soluble fiber treats global IBS symptoms  (Draws water into gut which softens stools, lowers cholesterol and blood glucose)•E.g., black beans, lima beans Brussel sprouts sweet potato broccoli•25-30 grams/day
