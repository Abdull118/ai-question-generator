Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)Refers to two chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorders1.Ulcerative colitis2.Crohn diseaseDO NOT CONFUSE WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)•Incidence¹•North America•Ulcerative colitis: 19.3 per 100,000•Crohn disease: 20.2 per 1000,000•Prevalence: 285 per 100,000 in North America and 500 per 100,000 in Europe•Europe•Ulcerative colitis: 24.3 per 100,000•Crohn disease: 12.7 per 100,000•Prevalence 320 per 100,000 in both North America and Europe•Bimodal age presentation 20’s-40’s then 60’s•Genetic and environmental factors•Caucasians, Jewish > Hispanic or Asian•Females = males•Causes largely unknown•Inappropriate, overactive mucosal immune response to commensal intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals¹Data from Goldman Cecil Textbook of Internal Medicine, 26th e. chapter 132, pages 898-907, e2

IBD: Genetic Factors •5-20% of patient with IBD have 1st degree family members with the disease•Greater than 200 gene susceptibility loci have been linked to IBD, with at least 30 specific for Crohn disease & more than 20 specific for ulcerative colitis•NOD2 gene (CARD -15) on chromosome 16 •First gene discovered for Crohn disease •15-25% Crohn with fibro-stenotic terminal ileal disease  •IL-23R on chromosome 1•Crohn disease•May be seen with ulcerative colitis, psoriasis & ankylosing spondylitis •Others: IBD5, ATG16L1

Immunologic & Environmental Factors•Immunologic factors•Over activation of the immune system•Environmental factors•Smoking is protective in UC•Smoking in Crohn leads to more aggressive disease

Ulcerative Colitis:Major Complications1.Toxic Megacolon•Gross dilation of the large bowel, fever, abdominal pain, dehydration, tachycardia, bloody diarrhea2.Perforation•Increased incidence  in face of toxic megacolon active colitis especially on steroids3.GI bleed - anemia4.Colonic adenocarcinoma


UC Major Complication:Adenocarcinoma of the Colon•Increased 10 to 20-fold, in left & pancolitis after 8-10 years of disease•Colonoscopy with surveillance every 1-2 years after 8-10 years of diagnosis in pancolitis and 12-15 years in left side colitis, yearly exams after 20-years of disease•Proctitis is not associated increased risk•Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) increased risk and need annual colon surveillance biopsies•Chromoendoscopy•Colectomy in flat high-grade dysplasia, multifocal flat low-grade dysplasia, unifocal flat low-grade dysplasia or any evidence of colorectal cancer


Crohn Disease

Crohn Disease Clinical Features•Common:•Weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue distention, nausea, vomiting•Bloody diarrhea uncommon compared to UC•Ileocecal Crohn mimics acute appendicitis•Right lower quadrant pain, fever•In chronic Crohn inflammation•Fistula formation•Fibrosis•Stricture•Partial or complete obstruction•Palpable inflammatory mass, abdominal pain, distention•Malabsorption •Vitamin deficiency B12, fat-soluble vitamin A, D, E, K 


Crohn Disease: Distribution•“Mouth to anus”•Esophagus, stomach, & duodenum 5%•Small intestine 30% •Ileocecal & proximal large bowel 40%•Colon 25% •Usually, rectum sparing•Perianal involvement•fissure, fistulas & abscesses

Treatment of IBD

Treatment of IBDGOAL is to reduce inflammation and subsequently induce and maintain clinical remission while simultaneously healing the mucosaAmino salicylates•Sulfasalazine + folic acid•5 ASA: Oral or topicalAntibiotics•Ciprofloxacin, MetronidazoleSteroids•Topical, Oral, and/or Intravenous Prednisone•BudesonideImmunomodulators•Azathioprine• 6-MP•Methotrexate•CyclosporineBiologics•Infliximab, Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Natalizumab, Vedolizumab Others•JAK Janus Kinase inhibitors: tofacitinib•SLP Modulators: Ozanimod•IL 12 and IL 23 blocker: UstekinumabSupportive •Vitamins B12, D, Calcium, Multivitamin, folic acid•Antidiarrheal, bile salt resins•Diet 

Treatment of IBD: SurgeryIndications for Surgery•Obstruction•Perforation •Toxic megacolon•Dysplasia or CancerProceduresUlcerative colitis•Total proctocolectomy with ileostomy•Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (complications: pouchitis, fecal incontinence, reduced fertility)Crohn Disease•Segmental resection•Stricturoplasty•Fistulectomy•Abscess drainage

Take Home Points!•Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorders1.Ulcerative colitis2.Crohn disease•Do not confuse IBD with IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)!•Diagnosis starts with good history & physical exam.•Look for extraintestinal manifestations of IBD!•Definitive diagnosis of either UC or Crohn Disease made with endoscopy and tissue samples.•Treatment based on severity of symptoms and complications.
