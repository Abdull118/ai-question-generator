CASE REPORT

Meningitis due to Bacillus cereus: A case report
and review of the literature

Michael P Stevens MD, Kara Elam MPH, Gonzalo Bearman MD MPH

MP Stevens, K Elam, G Bearman. Meningitis due to Bacillus
cereus: A case report and review of the literature. Can J Infect
Dis Med Microbiol 2012;23(1):e16-e19.

Bacillus cereus is infrequently associated with invasive central nervous
system (CNS) disease. Infection is associated with conditions that
lead to reduced host immunity and provide direct access to the CNS,
such as spinal anesthesia and ventricular tubes and shunts. A case of
ventriculitis secondary to B cereus in a patient receiving intrathecal
chemotherapy is reported, along with a review of the current lit-
erature. B cereus can colonize medical devices, thus posing a risk for
invasive disease. Despite aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum
anti-infectives, the mortality of CNS invasive B cereus is high.
Clinicians should not dismiss Gram-positive rods resembling Bacillus
species from normally sterile sites as contaminants in critically ill
patients. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be promptly initiated
to limit morbidity and mortality.

La méningite attribuable au Bacillus cereus :
un rapport de cas et une analyse
bibliographique

Le Bacillus cereus s’associe rarement & une maladie invasive du systéme
nerveux central (SNC). Linfection est liée 4 des pathologies qui réduisent
Pimmunité de ’héte et procurent un accés direct au SNC, telles qu’une
rachianesthésie et des tubes et dérivations ventriculaires. Les auteurs
rendent compte d’un cas de ventriculite secondaire 4 un B cereus chez un
patient sous chimiothérapie intratéchale et présentent une analyse des
publications A jour. Le B cereus peut coloniser les dispositifs médicaux,
posant ainsi un risque de maladie invasive. Malgré un traitement énergique
au moyen d’anti-infectieux A large spectre, la mortalité attribuable au
B cereus invasif du SNC est élevée. Les cliniciens ne devraient pas rejeter
la possibilité que des bacilles Gram positif évocateurs d’espéces de Bacillus
dans les foyers normalement stériles soient des contaminants chez les
patients gravement malades. Il faudrait amorcer rapidement une
antibiothérapie pertinente pour limiter la morbidité et la mortalité.
