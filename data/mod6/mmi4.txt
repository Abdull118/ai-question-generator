Intra-abdominal InfectionsMMI 2GI ModuleDavid Manna Ph.D.david.manna@touro.edu 

Objectives•Identify the difference in primary versus secondary peritonitis•Describe the risk factors and for developing infections in the peritoneal cavity•Identify the routes of entry in peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses•Define the components of pus in an abscess•Identify the common bacterial etiologies found in abscesses•Identify the common bacterial etiologies found in appendicitis•Identify the common bacterial etiologies found in diverticulitis 

Gastrointestinal Tract Perforations & Peritonitis
•Peritoneal Cavity is sterile and GI flora is rich in microbes•Breaches leads to peritonitis, ascites fluid infection, or abscess formation•Primary peritonitis: liver cirrhosis, gram negatives espE. coli•Secondary peritonitis is due to lesions, mechanical damage and risk factors, mixed infections•Peritonitis & ascites infection starts and then may progress to abscess formation

•Primary peritonitis is the ‘easy’ part and has a smaller list of etiologies•Occurs without apparent source of infection or breach•This lecture is much more focused on secondary peritonitis which will have mixed, polymicrobial infections

Gastrointestinal Tract Perforations & Secondary Peritonitis•Outcome depends on size of inoculum, ability of local immune defenses to contain, efficacy of antibiotic regimen•1 ml of gut contents will contain millions of microorganisms •Fever, localized pain, nausea, vomiting, septic complications are common symptoms once infection spreads

Risk factors that can lead to GI mucosa breach•Some common risk factors in secondary peritonitis•surgery•trauma•vomiting•obstructions•IBD•appendicitis•peptic ulcer •diverticulitis •neoplasms •infections

Abdominal Abscesses and Pus
•Usually after a breach in the normal mucosal defense barrier or change in normal structure/function/drainage•Etiology depends on source ie where is the breach in mucosa•Immune system attacks and get local accumulation of pus•Pus = •Dead PMNs, Macrophages•Dead microbes•Damaged tissue•Serum components (ie complement)•Also can have live microbes!!


Intra-abdominal abscesses
•Predominately coliforms, E. coli and Bacteroidesfragilis most common•E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp, Enterobacter spp, Streptococci, anaerobes•Candida, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas common in nosocomial or immunocompromised•When ‘upper GI’ with perforated peptic ulcer: Gram positives or Candida•Drain abscess and address breach•Severe cases: empiric antibiotics asap, ideally before samples obtained •Risk factors, infection source and local resistance dataPeritoneal fluid Gram stain

Anaerobes in this Setting•Clinical Cues•Putrid drainage•PolymicrobialGram stain•Infection is by normal adjacent flora •Abscess formation•Most treated empirically as it is difficult to culture these pathogens•Bacteroidesmost common etiology•Rare causes•Actinomyces: G+ branching rod •Fusobacterium: Thin G- rod

Abscess Pathogen Spotlight: Bacteroides fragilis
•Small Gram negative rod•Prominent anaerobe in the colon, 1-2% •Can tolerate small amounts of O2, reason it is a prominent abscess former•GI mucosa surgery or trauma entry•Polysaccharide Capsule •Stimulates TLR-2 activation & inflammation•Modified Lipid A in LPS with reduced endotoxin activity (100-1000x lower)•Enterotoxins found in small subgroup•Anaerobic culture is slow and difficult•BacteroidesBile Esculinagar (BBE)•Growing drug resistance•Metronidazole and carbapenems still a good option•Clindamycin ~20-60% resistance rates•Cefoxitin ~0-20% resistance rates

Appendicitis•Typically caused by nonspecific obstruction of appendix lumen•Fecal material, undigested food, enlarged lymphoid follicle in epithelial lining, bend/twist of the organ•Increasing susceptibility with age (peak in 10-19 y/o group)•Bacterial overgrowth follows, invasion, inflammation, ischemia, gangrene, perforation, abscess•Common Etiologies: E. coli, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas•Prophylactic dose of broad spectrum antibiotic before surgery

Diverticulitis•Small pockets in the colon becoming infected or swollen with inflammation•Microscopic or macroscopic perforations form, leads to abscesses•Common etiologies found in diverticular abscesses•E. coli, Streptococcusspp., anaerobes like Bacteroides•Broad spectrum antibiotics commonly used to treat acute cases, especially targeting E. coli and Bacteroides•Links to a low fiber diet
