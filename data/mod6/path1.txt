Here we go! Roller coaster ride!


Oral Cavity •Inflammatory•Infectious •Malignant

Aphthous Ulcers (Canker Sores)•Extremely 
common (20% population) , 
painful, shallow ulcers•Small (usually 
< 5 mm in diameter)•Appear on the non-keratinized oral mucosa•More common in the first 2 decades of life •Triggered by:    stress, fever, ingestion of certain foods,  activation of inflammatory bowel disease•Self-limited resolve within a few weeks

Aphthous
 
ulcersPale ulceration with an erythema


Behcet’s Disease•Severe recurrent aphthous ulcers.•Tends to be familial in the Middle East

Herpetic Stomatitis: cold sores or fever blisters •common infection caused by HSV type 1•transmitted from person to person thru direct contact•reactivation by fever, sun or cold exposure, respiratory tract infection, trauma•recurrences are common

•
solitary or multiple small vesicles containing clear fluid•occur most often 
on lips or nasal 
orifices •soon rupture, leaving painful ulcers that heal within a few weeks•Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (Eye).  Do not treat with steroid eye drops. It makes it worse, and can cause blindnessHerpetic Stomatitis: cold sores or fever blisters 

Herpetic Stomatitis: cold sores or fever blisters 

Herpetic Stomatitis: cold sores or fever blisters 
Intranuclear viral inclusions

Oral candidiasis (thrush, moniliasis)•white circumscribed membrane within the oral cavity; Easily scrapes off•common fungal infection •higher risk:–antibiotic or glucocorticoid therapy –diabetes mellitus–anemia–immunodeficiency–AIDS patients –disseminated cancer

Measles: Koplick spot(Pathognomonic, preceding the rash by 3-4 days)


Mumps

•Paramyxovirus•Spread by saliva; direct contact•Unvaccinated children commonly infected•Painful swelling of the salivary glands•Fever•Unilateral testicular swelling/pain; •In adults more severe to cause infertilityMumps

Leukoplakia


Leukoplakia•white, well-defined mucosal patch •epidermal thickening or hyperkeratosis •more frequent among older men •Risk Factors: tobacco, chronic friction, alcohol abuse•3% - 6% transformation risk to squamous cell carcinoma•Much higher risk of transformation  if it is red  {Why?}

Cancers of the Oral Cavity and Tongue•Mostly are squamous cell carcinomas•Risk Factors:–Leukoplakia (particularly if it is a reddish leukoplakia)–Human papillomavirus  (HPV 16, 18) –Tobacco  and Alcohol (prognosis is better in HPV patients, compared to tobacco-induced carcinomas)

•Clinical Features: asymptomatic, pain, difficulty in chewing•Sites of oral cavity carcinomas in order of frequency:1) vermilion border of the lateral margins of the lower lip2) floor of the mouth3) lateral borders of the mobile tongueCancers of the Oral Cavity and Tongue

SALIVARY GLAND DISEASES •Inflammation: Sialadenitis•Tumors

Sialadenitis•Sialadenitis: Inflammation of the salivary glands 
Acute 
sialadenitis
: 
•
Viral: mainly mumps
•
Bacterial: •Ductal obstruction by stone (sialolithiasis) severe dehydration 

SialadenitisChronic sialadenitis: •Autoimmune sialadenitis (bilateral)–Mainly Sjögren syndrome:•dry mouth (xerostomia) •dry eyes (kerato-conjunctivitis sicca)

Sialadenitis

•Autoimmune•Inflammation & destruction of gland tissue (Lacrimal, salivary)•Dry eyes, dry mouth, cavitiesSjogren’s Syndrome

Salivary Gland Tumors•80% of tumors occur within the parotid glands •most of the others in the submandibular glands (60% benign) •Males and females are affected equally

Salivary Gland Tumors•Benign tumors of the parotids: (70% to 80%)–benign pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor) –papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum (Warthin tumor) •Malignant tumor of the parotid:–malignant mixed tumors –mucoepidermoid carcinoma 

Pleomorphic Adenoma •aka Mixed Tumor of Salivary Glands•90% of benign tumors of the salivary glands•slow-growing, well-demarcated, encapsulated•< 6 cm in greatest dimension•often arising in the superficial parotid

Pleomorphic Adenoma •causes painless swelling at the angle of the jaw•Characteristic histologic feature is heterogeneity. Tumor cells form ducts, acini, tubules, strands, or sheets of cells •Treatment: excision, 10% are followed by recurrence

Pleomorphic adenoma

Esophagus•Infection•Congenital•Structural/Mechanical  disorders•Inflammation•Tumors

Upper GI - Symptoms •dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) - Esophagus•odynophagia (pain on swallowing)- Esophagus•heartburn (retrosternal burning pain) - Stomach•hematemesis (vomiting blood, coffee grounds)-  Stomach•melena (black tarry stool, from upper GI bleeding)- Stomach

Tracheo-esophageal fistula types:


Tracheo-esophageal fistula:

Structural/ Mechanical  disorders•Webs & rings•Diverticulum•Achalasia•Herniations•Lacerations•Varices

Esophageal webs & rings


Esophageal rings & websTerms used interchangeably, but…•Webs: Asymmetrical•Rings: concentricClinical presentation: Dysphagia, difficulty swallowing

A:  Uncommon; muscular ring; rarely symptomaticB: Schatzki ring (actually web); only mucosa and submucosa; located at squamocolumnar junctionC: RARE; indentation at the diaphragmatic cruraHH: Hiatal hernia; V: Vestibule
Esophageal rings & webs: Factoids

Esophageal rings & webs


Most common

Esophageal webs: Plummer-Vinson syndrome•Link between iron deficiency and esoph webs still controversial•Syndrome: Dysphagia, upper esoph webs, and iron deficiency•Women, age 40-70 yrs•Increased risk for Squamous cell carcinoma

Esophageal webs: Plummer-Vinson syndrome
diverticulum

Zenker Diverticulum•Rare, Males, Elderly (70-90 yrs) •Posterior herniation esoph mucosa between the cricopharyngeal muscle and inferior constrictor muscles

Zenker Diverticulum:Occurs in a muscular dehiscence

Zenker Diverticulum•Retention of undigested food and secretions in pouch•Sensation of food stuck in throat•Halitosis, regurgitation, dysphagia, cough after eating•Complications: Aspiration pneumonia (common); Squamous cell carcinoma (rare) 

Zenker Diverticulum


Achalasia= Esoph motility disorder•Primary: Loss of myenteric plexus ganglion cells•Secondary: Chagas disease, Malignancies, Diabetes mellitus •Absence of peristalsis•Impaired LES relaxation•Esoph. dilatation proximal to the lower esoph sphincter (LES)

Achalasia: Clinical Features•Manifest 
mainly in young adulthood•Progressive dysphagia•Chest pain, heartburn•Nocturnal regurgitation and aspiration of undigested food may occur
•
Complications:
–
esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma in ~ 5%

Achalasia•Incomplete relaxation of LES in response to swallowing•High resting LES pressure•Absent esoph peristalsis

Hiatal Hernia •Protrusion of the stomach above the diaphragm

Hiatal Hernia: Types

Hiatal Hernia: Clinical features•reported in 1% to 20% of adult subjects,•increasing incidence with age•heartburn or regurgitation of gastric juices into the mouth•Complications:–reflux esophagitis (mainly sliding)–mucosal ulceration–bleeding–perforation–many go on to develop a Barrett esophagus

Lacerations (Mallory-Weiss tears) •Superficial longitudinal tears in the esophagus at GE junction•may involve only the mucosa ØContrast: Boerhaave syndrome = penetration of  the wall•Causes:–chronic alcoholics after severe vomiting–acute illnesses with severe vomiting and coughing

Lacerations (Mallory-Weiss tears) Clinical Features:•Hematemesis •account for 5% - 10% of upper GI bleeding Complications: •Infection, inflammatory ulcer, mediastinitis

Mallory-Weiss tear

Tear in Esophagus

A Mallory-Weiss
tear is a tear in
the mucosal layer
at the junction

of the esophagus
and stomach

Esophageal Varices•The increased pressure in the esophageal plexus produces dilated tortuous vessels (
varices)Causes:•Cirrhosis –in ~ two thirds of all cirrhotic patients–most often associated with alcoholic cirrhosis •Portal hypertension 

Esophageal VaricesClinical Features:•Produce no symptoms until they rupture•Hematemesis•Massive hemorrhage into the lumen

Esophageal varices:A) Esophagus, showing varicesC) Hepatic venogram after injection of dye into portal veins (PV) to show a large tortuous varix 


MORPHOLOGY•Varices appear primarily as tortuous dilated veins lying primarily within the submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach


Esophageal varices: MORPHOLOGY


Next…. ESOPHAGITIS

ESOPHAGITIS•Common in Iran and China Causes:•prolonged gastric intubation•uremia•ingestion of corrosive or irritant substances•radiation or chemotherapy•reflux esophagitis:–Recurrent heartburn as its dominant symptom–Associated with sliding hiatal hernia –Associated with alcohol and smoking

Reflux esophagitis•Recurrent heartburn •Associated with hiatal hernia,  alcohol and smoking •Symptoms: Heartburn, Regurgitation•Complications:–Bleeding–Development of stricture–Barrett esophagus–Predisposition to malignancy

Acute esophagitis


Barrett Esophagus•Metaplasia: replacement of the normal stratified squamous mucosa by columnar epithelium  (gastric or intestinal type) •Occurs in 10% of patients with persistent GERD•Males > females (4:1) •more common in whites

Barrett Esophagus•Complication: –Ulcer –Stricture –Development of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (30-40 x increased risk)

ESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMATwo types: 1.Squamous cell carcinomasRisks: Smoking, alcohol, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, prior lye ingestion 2.Adenocarcinomas (based on gastric metaplasia in esophagus)

Esophageal carcinoma•Clinical Features:–dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)  –odynophagia (pain on swallowing–Hoarseness–Weight loss, anorexia, fatigue•Diagnosis:–imaging techniques –endoscopic biopsy

Esophageal carcinoma


Large ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus- 20% arise in cervical and upper thoracic esophagus- 50% in the middle third - 30% in the lower third

Treatment:
•
Prevention: routine screening mainly for patients with chronic esophagitis or Barrett esophagus
•
