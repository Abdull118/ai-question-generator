Objectives:1.Discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, morphology, and laboratory evaluation of acute pancreatitis2.Compare and contrast the morphology and clinical manifestations of acute and chronic pancreatitis•Recognize pseudocyst formation as a complication of chronic pancreatitis•Distinguish pancreatic pseudocyst from cystadenoma

Objectives:3.Discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, morphology, and clinical manifestation of benign and malignant pancreatic neoplasms (i.e. cystadenoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, and islet cell tumors)•Associate Courvosier sign (Dilated, enlarged palpable gallbladder) with an obstructive process (i.e. pancreatic tumor located in the head of the pancreas, or cholelithiasis in biliary duct)4.Explain the causes and pathogenic mechanism of appendicitis and peritonitis•Differentiate the condition of ascites from peritonitis•Recognize the use of paracentesis as a diagnostic test for the evaluation of ascites •Differentiate the pathogenic mechanism of acute bacterial from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Normal pancreasendocrine & exocrine functions

Normal pancreas


Overview: BloodFunctions:•Transports oxygen & nutrients to cells•Transports waste & CO2 away from cells•Delivers hormones & regulatory substances to & from cells•Maintains homeostasisØ Thermoregulation (vaso-dilation/constriction)Ø Hemostasis (platelets and clotting factors)•Transports cells & humoral agents of immune system (inflammation/infection)
Rubin’s	Fig	14-5


Pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis•Activated pancreatic enzymes: Trypsin, Amylase, Lipase•Blockage by obstruction, stricture, fibrosis will retain the lipase in the area -> fat necrosis•Alcohol can be toxic to pancreas•Other: Drugs, Viruses, Hyperlipidemia, Hypercalcemia, Idiopathic pancreatitis, Parasites (ascariasis)

Complications of chronic pancreatitis
Old necrotic areas will lead to calcifications

Complications of chronic pancreatitis
Fibrosis/Atrophy – Can lead to DM

Complications of chronic pancreatitis
Pseudocysts = Cysts that lack an epithelial lining

Complications of chronic pancreatitis

Stones in
pancreatic duct

Cystadenoma = Tumors of the pancreas (gross examination)Serous: clear fluid


Cystadenoma = Tumors of the pancreas (Histologic examination)Serous: usually benign

Cystadenoma = Tumors of the pancreas (gross examination)Mucinous: Mucoid material


Cystadenoma = Tumors of the pancreas (Histologic examination)• Mucinous: Benign• Can have malignant potential

Islet cells
Immunohistochemical staining:A. Alpha cells – GlucagonB. Beta cells- InsulinC. Delta cells - Somatostatin 

Islet cell tumors: Insulinoma

Rubin’s TABLE 15-2 Secretory Products of Islet Cells and Their Physiological Actions CellSecretory ProductPhysiological ActionsAlphaGlucagonCatabolic, stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, raises blood glucoseBetaInsulinAnabolic, stimulates glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis, lowers blood glucoseDeltaSomatostatinInhibits secretion of alpha, beta, D1, and acinar cellsD1Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)Verner-Morrison syndrome (Pancreatic cholera)Same as glucagon; also regulates tone and motility of GI tract and activates cAMP of intestinal epitheliumWHDA syndrome: Watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria 

Pancreatic cancer = Ductal adenocarcinoma• Increased risks: Smoking, chronic pancreatitis, & DM• 60% headØ Usually presents as painless jaundice (Obstructive jaundice)• 15% body•  5% tailØ Early phases can be asymptomatic• Can have elevated CEA & CA19-9 antigens (tumor markers)• Aggressive & invasive; High mortality

Pancreatic cancer = Ductal adenocarcinoma


1) Tail of Pancreas: Ductal Adenocarcinoma2)  Liver: Metastatic lesions


Pancreatic cancer associations

Peritonitis
 
= Inflammation of 
the peritoneum (not in Robbin’s Basic)Causes:§“Sterile”: Leakage of bile or pancreatic enzymes§Endometriosis Ø Hemorrhage & resultant inflammation§Foreign material: surgery, ruptured teratomaØ Granulomas§Perforation of biliary system or abdominal viscera

Peritonitis
 
= Inflammation of the 
peritoneum (not in Robbin’s Basic)Causes:§Bacterial: Acute appendicitis, Diverticulitis, Intestinal ischemia, Acute salpingitis, Cholecystitis, Peritoneal dialysis, Abdominal trauma (i.e stabbing)Ø Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis:  In absence of source of contamination• Associated in pts with cirrhosis & ascites, kids with nephrotic syndrome

Paracentesis = drainage of fluid from the peritoneumUsually performed for:§New onset ascites§Ascites of unknown origin§Known ascites with fever, abd pain§Symptomatic treatment of large ascites

Paracentesis = drainage of fluid from the peritoneum


Peritonitis = a cause of acute abdomen

Peritonitis = a cause of acute abdomen

Case 1A 68 year old female presents with severe abdominal pain. PE:  fever, tenderness with guarding localized to the left lower quadrant. CBC: neutrophilia with left shift. Paracentesis: mixed bacterial flora with many neutrophils in the peritoneal fluid.Diagnoses?   Cause of acute abdomen? 

Diverticulosis
http:www.pathology.pitt.edu

Case 1: Diverticulitis w/ Peritonitis
Right: Impaction of fecalith causes bacterial proliferation, edema, inflammation, and potential  for perforation, peritonitis, or fistula formationhttp://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/slideshow-diverticulitis-overview

Case 2A 59 year old male c/o 2 day h/o abd pain. He has a h/o chronic alcoholism & has noticed increasing abdominal girth for the past 6 months. PE: Temp 38.2C; ABD: fluid wave and prominent caput medusae. No abd tenderness or guardingRadiography: Upright Abd film shows no free airParacentesis:     500 ml cloudy, yellow fluid; Microscopy: Neutrophils, reactive mesothelial cells , and bacteriaGram stain of fluid:  Gram-neg rodsDiagnoses?

Case 2 Diagnosis: Spontaneous Bacterial  Peritonitis (Review slide #21)§This pt does not have an acute abd (no guarding, tenderness)§Ascitic fluid was not just transudative; incidental finding of bacteria§No source of visceral perforation or contamination§Bacteria can invade the bowel wall or spread hematogenously(E. coli common)
Ascites & Caput medusae 

Case 3A 17 year old male presents with abdominal pain that initially was generalized, but then localized to the right lower quadrantPE: Fever, 4+ rebound tenderness in the RLQ and generalized guarding. CBC: elevated WBC count 11,500 with left shift (increased bandforms)

Case 3 Diagnosis:  Appendicitis w/ rupture &  Peritonitis

Appendicitis w/ rupture & peritonitisCut surface:
Mucosa
Transmural wall weakness & thinning (lead to perforation & rupture)
