GASTRIC POLYPS AND TUMORS

Inflammatory and Hyperplastic Gastric Polyps•Most gastric polyps are inflammatory or hyperplastic polyps•Chronic inflammation drives the development of these polyps•Most common 50-60 years of age•Association with chronic gastritis (H pylori!) –Injury!–Reactive hyperplasia and polyp growth•Polyps larger than 1.5 cm should be resected and examined histologically! 

Inflammatory and Hyperplastic Gastric Polyps•Morphology–Smaller than 1 cm–Multiple–Ovoid in shape with smooth surfaces–Surface ulceration •Microscopically–Irregular, cystically dilated and elongated foveolar glands–Lamina propria is edematous with acute and chronic inflammation

Inflammatory and Hyperplastic Gastric Polyps


Inflammatory and Hyperplastic Gastric Polyps


Fundic Gland Polyps •Occur sporadically and in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) •Proton pump inhibitor therapy has increased their prevalence 

Fundic Gland Polyps•Morphology–Occur in the gastric body and fundus–Well-circumscribed lesions with a smooth surface–Single or multiple •Microscopy–Cystically dilated irregular glands lined by flattened parietal and chief cells–Inflammation is absent or minimal–Dysplasia and cancer may occur in FAP-associated fundic gland polyps but not in sporadic! 

Fundic Gland Polyps


Fundic Gland Polyps


Gastric Adenoma•10% of all gastric polyps•Frequency increases with age•50-60 years of age•Males are affected 3x more than females•Incidence is increased in individuals with FAP•Almost always occurs on a background of chronic gastritis with atrophy and intestinal metaplasia •Risk of adenocarcinoma is related to the size of the lesion and is particularly increased in lesions greater than 2 cm in diameter•Carcinoma may be present in up to 30% of gastric adenomas 

Gastric Adenomas•Morphology–Solitary lesions less than 2 cm in diameter –Most common in the antrum•Microscopy–Intestinal-type columnar epithelium that exhibits varying degrees of dysplasia–Low grade or high grade dysplasia–Enlargement, elongation, pseudostratification and hyperchromasia of epithelial cell nuclei and epithelial crowding–High grade dysplasia has more severe cytologic atypia and irregular architecture, including glandular budding and gland-within-gland, or cribriform, structures–PRE-MALIGNANT LESIONS

Gastric Adenomas
www.nature.com

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•The most common malignancy of the stomach - > 90% of all gastric cancers•High incidence in Japan•More common in lower socioeconomic groups and in individuals with multifocal mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Gastric dysplasia and adenomas are the precursor lesions to gastric adenocarcinoma•The cause of the overall reduction in gastric cancer is most closely linked to decreases in H. pylori prevalence •BOTH host genetic background and environmental factors affect risk 

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Chronic inflammation promotes gastric neoplasia!–Genetic alterations of pro-inflammatory and immune response genes that are associated with elevated risk of gastric cancer when accompanied by H. pylori infection:•IL-1β, TNF, IL-10, IL-8, and TLR4

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Familial Gastric Cancer–Germline loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDH1 (encodes for E-cadherin)–Loss of E-cadherin is a key step in the development of diffuse gastric cancer

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Sporadic Gastric Cancer–Strongly associated with mutations that result in increased signaling via the Wnt pathway•Loss-of-Function of APC tumor suppressor gene•Gain-of-Function of B-catenin–FAP patients who carry a germline APC mutation have increased risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Morphology:–Classified according to location and gross and histologic morphology–Most involve gastric antrum–Lesser curvature > greater curvature–Intestinal Type Gastric Cancer forms bulky tumors composed of glandular structures–Diffuse Type Gastric Cancer are composed of signet ring cells 

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Intestinal Type Gastric Cancer–Grow along broad cohesive fronts to form either an exophytic mass or an ulcerated tumor–Neoplastic cells often contain apical mucin vacuoles  with abundant mucin within gland lumina

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Diffuse Type Gastric Cancer–Composed of discohesive cells (the result of E-cadherin loss)–Cells do not form glands! –The cells have large mucin vacuoles that expand the cytoplasm and push the nucleus the periphery creating a signet-ring cell morphology–The cells permeate the mucosa and stomach wall individually or in small clusters –Desmoplastic reaction that stiffens that gastric wall à Leather bottle appearance “Linitis Plastica”

+ A tumour may penetrate muscularis propria with extension into the gastrocolic or gastrohepatic ligaments or the greater and lesser omentum without perforation of the visceral peri-
manor these structures. In this case, the tumour is classified as T2. If there is perforation of the visceral peritoneum covering the gastric ligaments or omenta, the tumour
is as
‘The adjacent structures of the stomach are the spleen, transverse colon, liver, diaphragm, pancreas, abdominal wall, adrenal gland, kidney, small intestine, and retroperitoneum.

* Intramural extension to the duodenum or oesophagus is classified by the depth of greatest invasion in any of these sites including stomach.

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•Metastases :–supraclavicular sentinel lymph node (Virchow node)–Periumbilical lymph nodes (sister Mary Joseph nodule)–The left axillary lymph node (Irish node)–The ovary (Krukenberg tumor)–The pouch of Douglas (Blumer shelf)

Gastric Adenocarcinoma•RISK FACTORS!


GASTRIC LYMPHOMA

Gastric Lymphoma•Extranodal lymphomas commonly arise in the GI tract, particularly the stomach!•5% of all gastric malignancies•Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell lymphomas (MALTomas)

Gastric MALTomas•Associated with H. pylori infection!–Arise at sites of chronic inflammation–MALT in the stomach is induced because of chronic gastritis due to H. pylori–H. pylori eradication results in remission with low rates of recurrence in most MALToma patients•Translocations:–t(11;18)(q21;q21)–t(1:14)(p22;q32)–T(14;18)(q32;q21)–Cause activation of NF-ᴋβ (promotes B cell growth and survival)•H. Pylori induced chronic inflammation may trigger NF-ᴋβ activation through the MLT/BCL-10) pathway in MALTomas that lack these translocations–H. Pylori eradication leads to remission! 

Gastric MALToma•H. pylori treatment is ineffective:–Tumors bearing translocations involving MLT or BCL10–Tumors that are invaded into the muscularis propria or beyond and lymph node involvement•Low grade MALTomas can transform to high grade–Inactivation of p53 and p16 genes–H. pylori treatment is ineffective as well

Gastric MALToma•Morphology–Dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria–The neoplastic lymphocytes infiltrate the gastric glands focally to create diagnostic lymphoepithelial lesions–Express B-cell markers•CD19/CD20–Monoclonality may be demonstrated by restricted expression of either ᴋ or λ immunoglobulin light chains

•Notes:–Gastrointestinal lymphomas that arise from MALT are called MALT lymphomas or MALTomas•Can occur in assoc. with H. pylori infection•Treatment with antibiotics eliminates H. Pylori and eliminates the stimulus for B-cell growth•H. pylori chronic gastritis may precede lymphoma development and would show a mixed inflammatory infiltrate•Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are NOT MALTomas and do not regress with antibiotic therapy•Autoimmune gastritis is a risk for developing gastric adenocarcinoma•Crohn disease is not assoc. with H. Pylori 

CARCINOID TUMOR

Carcinoid Tumor•Most are found in the GI tract, most commonly in the small intestine/appendix•Associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, MEN-1, and Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome•Peaks in sixth decade of life 

Carcinoid Tumor•Carcinoid tumors of the stomach and ileum may cause carcinoid syndrome–Serotonin release leads to cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm and abdominal cramps•Carcinoid tumors of the proximal duodenum may cause Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome–Large amounts of gastrin released leads to too much acid production which then leads to peptic ulcers, diarrhea and other symptoms

Carcinoid Tumor•When tumors are confined to the intestine, the vasoactive substances released are metabolized to inactive forms by the liver (No Carcinoid Syndrome!)•When there is a large tumor burden or when the hormones are secreted into a nonportal venous circulation (Carcinoid Syndrome!)•Metastatic disease in the liver is STRONGLY associated with carcinoid syndrome because the hormone is released directly into the systemic circulation

Carcinoid Tumor•The most important prognostic factor for GI carcinoid tumors is LOCATION!–Foregut Carcinoids: found in stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. Rarely metastasize. Generally cured by resection–Midgut Carcinoids: found in jejunum and ileum. Often multiple. Tend to be aggressive. –Hindgut Carcinoids: found in appendix and colorectum. Discovered incidentally. Almost always benign. Mets are uncommon

GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMOR

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor•The most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen•Most commonly occur in the stomach•Arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal (pacemaker cells) of the gastrointestinal muscularis propria•Peak at 60 years•GISTs in children are associated with Carney Triad (Gastric GIST, Paraganglioma and Pulmonary Chrondroma)•Increased incidence with NF-1

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor•Pathogenesis:–Gain-of-Function mutations of Tyrosine Kinase Receptor (KIT) (CD117) –Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α gene mutations (PDGFRA)–Both promote tumor cell proliferation and survival–Mutations in Succinate dehydrogenase complex (SDH) Increased risk for paraganglioma and GIST

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors•Morphology–Solidary, well-circumscribed fleshy mass covered by ulcerated or intact mucosa, but can also project outward toward the serosa–Cut surface shows a whorled appearance! –Metastases may take the form of multiple serosal nodules throughout the peritoneal cavity or as one or more nodules in the liver; spreads outside of the abdominal cavity is uncommon •Histology–Spindle Cell Type: Bundles or fascicles of spindle-shaped cells–Epithelioid Type: Dominated by epithelial appearing cells –Most useful diagnostic marker is KIT (95% of GIST) (CD117 IHC Stain)

KEY POINTS à STOMACH•Majority of gastric polyps are inflammatory or hyperplastic polyps, reactive lesions that are associated with chronic gastritis •Fundic gland polyps occur sporadically, most often as a consequence of proton pump inhibitor therapy, and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients•Gastric adenomas develop in a background of chronic gastritis and are particularly associated with intestinal metaplasia and mucosal atrophy. Adenocarcinoma is frequent in gastric adenomas, which therefore require more aggressive therapy than adenomas of the colon•Gastric Adenocarcinoma incidence varies markedly with geography. Individuals are classified according to location, gross and histologic morphology. Gastric tumors with an intestinal histology tend to form bulky tumors with and may be ulcerated, while those composed of signet ring cells typically display a diffuse infiltrative growth pattern that may thicken the gastric wall without forming a discrete mass. Gastric Adenocarcinomas are linked to H. pylori induced chronic gastritis

KEY POINTS à STOMACH•Primary gastric lymphomas are most often derived from MALT whose development is induced by chronic gastritis that is most often induced by H. pylori•Carcinoid Tumors arise from diffuse components of the endocrine system and are most commonly in the GI tract, particularly the small intestine. Prognosis is based on location; tumors of the small intestine tend to be most aggressive while those of the appendix are typically benign. •Gastrointestinal Stroma Tumor is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen, occurs most often in the stomach, and is related to benign pacemaker cells, or interstitial cells of Cajal. Tumors generally have activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA tyrosine kinases and respond to specific kinase inhibitors 

POLYPS AND TUMORS OF THE SMALL AND LARGE INTESTINE 

Polyps•Most common in the colo-rectal region•Begin as small elevations of the mucosa (sessile) –Some may enlarge to form stalks•Pedunculated •Non-neoplastic:–hamartomatous, inflammatory or hyperplastic•Neoplastic–adenoma


Hyperplastic Polyps•Benign epithelial proliferations that are typically discovered in the sixth and seventh decades of life•Decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding of surface epithelial cells leading to a “piling up” of goblet cells and absorptive cells.•MUST BE DISTINGUISHED FROM SESSILE SERRATED ADENOMAS 

Hyperplastic Polyps•Morphology–Most commonly found in the left colon and are smaller than 5 mm in diameter–Smooth, nodular protrusions of the mucosa, often on the crests of mucosal folds–May occur singly but are more frequently multiple, particularly in the sigmoid colon and rectum•Histology–Mature goblet and absorptive cells–Crowding creates a “serrated”  architecture that is the morphologic hallmark of these lesions


Hyperplastic Polyp

Hyperplastic Polyp


Hyperplastic Polyp
Serrated appearance!

Inflammatory Polyps•Polyps that form as part of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome are pure inflammatory lesions•Patients present with triad of rectal bleedings, mucus discharge and an inflammatory lesion of the anterior rectal wall.•Underlying cause:–Impaired relaxation of the anorectal sphincter that creates a sharp angle at the anterior rectal shelf and leads to recurrent abrasion and ulceration of the overlying rectal mucosa

Inflammatory Polyps•An inflammatory polyp may form as a result of chronic cycles of injury and healing•Entrapment of this polyp in the fecal stream leads to mucosal prolapse•Histology: –Mixed Inflammatory Infiltrates, dilated glands, erosion, and epithelial hyperplasia together with lamina propria fibromuscular hyperplasia

Inflammatory Polyps
pathologyoutlines.com

Hamartomatous Polyps•Occur sporadically or as components of various genetically determined or acquired syndromes•Germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes•Some syndrome are associated with increased cancer risk–Hamartomatous polyps may be premalignant–Associated with extra intestinal manifestations and possibly other family members are affected

Juvenile Polyps•Focal malformations of the epithelium and lamina propria•May be sporadic or syndromic•Majority occur in children younger than 5•Most located in the rectum and present with rectal bleeding•Intussusception, intestinal obstruction, or polyp prolapse may occur

Juvenile Polyp•Sporadic:–Usually solitary–Retention polyps–Not associated with cancer•Autosomal Dominant syndrome of Juvenile Polyposis:–Have from 3 to as many as 100 hamartomatous polyps and may require colectomy–Have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and other congenital malformations–Mutations of SMAD4 gene–30-50% develop colonic adenocarcinoma by age of 45

Juvenile Polyp•Morphology–Most are less than 3 cm in diameter–Pedunculated, smooth-surfaced, reddish lesions with characteristic cystic spaces apparent after sectioning•Histology–Dilated cystic glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris–Remainder of the polyp is composed of lamina propria expanded by mixed inflammatory infiltrates

Peutz-Jegher Syndrome•Rare autosomal dominate syndrome •Patients presents at a median age of 11 years with multiple GI hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation •Dark blue to brown macules on the lips, nostrils, buccal mucosa, palmar surfaces of the hands, genitalia and perianal regionPolps can initiate intussusception which is occasionally fatal•Associated with markedly increased risk of several malignancies!!!!–Birth: Sex cord tumors of testes–Late Childhood: Gastric and small intestinal cancers–Second and Third Decades: Colon, pancreatic, breast, lung, ovarian and uterine cancers

Peutz-Jegher Syndrome•Morphology–Most common in the small intestine• also colon, stomach, bladder and lungs–Large and pedunculated with lobulated contour•Histology–Characteristic arborizing network of connective tissue, smooth muscle, lamina propria and glands lined by normal-appearing intestinal epithelium

Peutz-Jegher Syndrome•Pathogenesis–Germline loss-of-function STK11 are present in a half of familial PJ patients as well as some sporadic

Neoplastic Polyps•Any neoplastic mass in the GI tract may produce a mucosal protrusion or polyp•The most common neoplastic polyps are colonic adenomas, which are precursors to colorectal adenocarcinomas•Adenomas are intraepithelial neoplasms that range from small often pedunculated polyps to large sessile lesions•Small male predominance•Present in approximately 30% of adults living in western world by age 60•All adults should undergo surveillance by age 50•Patients at increased risk:–Family history•Screened 10 years earlier than the family member was diagnosed–Western Diet 

Colorectal Adenomas•Characterized by the presence of epithelial dysplasia•Precursor lesions to adenocarcinoma–Prevalence of adenomas correlates with prevalence of adenocarcinoma–Distributions are similar–Regular surveillance and polyp removal reduces the incidence•Majority of adenomas DO NOT progress to become adenocarcinoma•Most adenomas are clinical silent

Colorectal Adenomas•Size is the most important characteristic that correlates with risk of malignancy–Cancer is extremely rare in adenomas < 1 cm–~40% of adenomas > 4 cm contain foci of cancer•High grade dysplasia is another risk factor

Colorectal Adenoma•Morphology–Range from 0.3 to 10 cm in diameter and can be pedunculated or sessile–Surface of adenoma is velvety or resembles a raspberry•Histology:–Hallmark of epithelial dysplasia isnuclear hyperchromasia, elongation and stratification

Adenomatous Polyposis•Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which patients develop numerous colorectal adenomas as teenagers•Caused by mutations of the APC (Adenomatous polyposis coli) gene •At least 100 polyps are required for diagnosis•Polyps are morphologically indistinguishable from sporadic adenomas, however, flat or depressed adenomas are also prevalent in FAP as well as microscopic adenomas 

Adenomatous Polyposis•Colorectal adenocarcinoma develops in 100% of untreated FAP patients, often before the age of 30 and nearly always by 50!!!!•Prophylactic colectomy is the standard therapy for individuals carrying APC mutations–Prevent colon cancer but these patients are at risk for neoplasia at other sites!•Adenomas may develop elsewhere in the GI tract – stomach; adjacent to ampulla of Vater 

Adenomatous Polyposis•FAP is associated with extraintestinal manifestations: –Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium – detected at birth!–Subtypes of FAP = Gardner Syndrome and Turcot Syndrome (APC gene mutations)

Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer•HNPCC aka Lynch Syndrome•Familial clustering of cancers at several sites including the colorectum, endometrium, stomach, ovary, ureters, brain, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, and skin•The most common syndromic form of colon cancer (2-4% of all colon cancer)•Colon cancers in HNPCC occur in younger ages than sporadic–Often located in the RIGHT colon•Caused by inherited mutation in genes that encode proteins responsive for the detection, excision and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication–MSH2 or MLH1

ADENOCARCINOMA

Colon Adenocarcinoma •The most common malignancy of the GI tract and major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide!!!•(Adenocarcinoma of small bowel is uncommon – adenocarcinomas and carcinoid tumors have equal incidence)•Responsible for ~10% of all cancer deaths worldwide•Incidence is highest in North America with the US accounting for approximately 10% of worldwide cases and cancer deaths•In the US, colorectal cancer represents 15% of all cancer-related deaths, second only to lung cancer•Peaks at 60 to 70 years of age 

Colon Adenocarcinoma•Dietary Factors:–Low intake of un-absorbable vegetable fiber and high intake of refined carbohydrates and fat–Reduced fiber content leads to decreased stool bulk and altered composition of the intestinal microbiota•Change may increase synthesis of potentially toxic oxidative by-products–High fat intake also enhances hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids which can be converted into carcinogens by intestinal bacteria

Colon Adenocarcinoma•Pharmacologic chemoprevention:–Several epidemiologic studies suggest that aspirin or other NSAIDs have a protective effect–Other studies have shown some NSAIDs cause polyp regression in FAP whose rectum was left in place after colectomy –Hypothesis is that inhibition of COX-2 (highly expressed in colon carcinoma/adenomas) •COX-2 is needed for Prostaglandin E2 production which promotes epithelial proliferation

Colon Adenocarcinoma•Pathogenesis:–Two genetic pathways•APC pathway•Microsatellite Instability Pathway –Stepwise accumulations of multiple mutations, but differ in their genes

Colon Adenocarcinoma
www.askdoctork.com

Colon Adenocarcinoma
1) APC gene mutation increases risk for polyp development2) KRAS mutation causes polyp to develop3) p53 mutation and increased COX expression cause progression to carcinoma•APC Pathway•Loss of one APC gene occurs early! First hit•Loss of second APC gene follows. Second hit•KRAS mutations, losses of 18q21 involving SMAD2/4  

Colon Adenocarcinoma•Mismatch Repair Pathway•In patients with mismatch repair deficiency, mutations accumulate in microsatellite repeats, a condition refereed to as microsatellite instability. •Some microsatellite sequences are located in promoter regions of genes like BAX (pro-apoptotic) and TGF-β (tumor suppressor gene)
1)Inherited or acquired early DNA mismatch repair gene mutations FIRST HIT2)SECOND HIT to second allele by mutation, LOH, or promoter methylation of MLH13)Microsatellite instability occurs causing accumulation of mutations in numerous genes4)Carcinoma develops when genes for cell proliferation and survival are involved!

Colon Adenocarcinoma•Morphology–Proximal Colon Tumors:•Polypoid, exophytic masses•Do not obstruct –Distal Colon Tumors:•Annular lesions•“Napkin Ring” constrictions and luminal narrowing•Can obstruct! –Both forms grow into the wall over time

Colonic Adenocarcinoma•Histology:–Tall columnar cells that resemble dysplastic epithelium found in adenomas–Invasive component elicits a strong stromal desmoplastic response–Some may have few glands; others have abundant goblet cells and mucin 

Colonic Adenocarcinoma•Clinical Features:–Right sided: fatigue and weakness due to iron deficiency anemia–Left sided: occult bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or cramping and left lower quadrant discomfort. 

Colonic Adenocarcinoma•The two most important prognostic factors are depth of invasion and the presence of lymph node metastases!! –Invasion through the muscularisà survival rate ↓•Additional Lymph node metastases à survival rate ↓↓•Metastasis to liver is most common! –Also regional lymph node, lung, bone

Most likely due to DNA mismatch repair genes (MSH2/MLH1)–APC pathway is associated with FAP and adenoma-carcinoma sequence–C-KIT mutation are in GISTs–PTEN loss is seen in endometrial Ca but not Colon–Infection with HPV leas to Rb protein inactivation and development of cervical Ca 

KEY CONCEPTS OF COLON TUMORS•Intestinal polyps can be classified as non-neoplastic or neoplastic. The non-neoplastic polyps can be further defined as hyperplasic, inflammatory or hamartomatous •Hyperplastic polyps are benign epithelial proliferations most commonly found in  the left colon and rectum. They have no malignant potential and must be distinguished from sessile serrated adenomas•Inflammatory polyps form as a result of chronic cycles of injury and healing•Hamartomatous polyps occur sporadically or as a part of genetic disease. The latter include juvenile polyposis and Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome which are associated with increased risk of malignancy•Benign epithelial neoplastic polyps of the intestines are termed adenomas. The hallmark of these lesions which are the precursors of colonic adenocarcinomas, is cytologic dysplasia•In contrast to traditional adenomas, sessile serrated adenomas lack cytologic dysplasia and share morphologic features with hyperplastic polyps 

KEY CONCEPTS OF COLON TUMORS•FAP and HNPCC are the most common forms of familial colon cancer•FAP is caused by APC mutations. Patients typically have more than 100 adenomas and develop colon cancer before 30 years of age•HNPCC is caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair enzymes. These patients have far fewer polyps and develop caner at older ages than FAP patients but younger ages than those with sporadic colon cancer•FAP and HNPCC typify distinct pathways of neoplastic transformation and progression that also contribute to the majority of sporadic colon cancers•Nearly all colonic cancers are adenocarcinomas. The two most important prognostic factors are depth of invasion and the presence or absence of lymph node metastases
