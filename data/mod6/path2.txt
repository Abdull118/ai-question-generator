Gastritis

Stomach - Symptoms of gastritis•heartburn •epigastric pain•nausea and vomiting•hematemesis (coffee grounds appearance of vomit)•melena  (black tarry stools, from oxidation of blood Hb in GI tract)

Gastritis•Inflammation of the gastric mucosa•Two types:1.acute gastritis2.chronic gastritis

Acute Gastric Ulceration•appear after severe stress Causes:•Severe trauma (major surgical procedures, sepsis)•Extensive burns (called Curling ulcers) •Traumatic or surgical injury to CNS (called Cushing ulcers) •Chronic exposure to drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids) 

•Heavy use of (NSAIDs), particularly aspirin •Excessive alcohol consumption •Heavy smoking •Treatment with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs •Uremia •Systemic infections (e.g., Salmonella) •Severe stress (e.g., trauma, burns, surgery) •Ischemia and shock •Suicide attempts with acids and alkali •Mechanical trauma (e.g., nasogastric intubation) •After distal gastrectomy with reflux of bilious material 
Acute Gastritis: causes

•an acute mucosal inflammatory process•may be 
asymptomatic
•
epigastric pain with 
nausea and vomiting
•
hematemesis
•
melenaAcute Gastritis: Clinical Features

Stress Ulcers: 
morphology•Usually 
multiple lesions •located mainly in stomach and occasionally in duodenum•found anywhere in the stomach•usually circular and 
small (< 1 cm in diameter) •They range in depth from very superficial lesions (
erosion) to deeper lesions that involve the entire mucosal thickness (
true ulceration)

Acute Gastritis with a diffusely hyperemic gastric mucosa 


Chronic GastritisDefinition: chronic mucosal inflammatory changes leading to mucosal atrophy and epithelial metaplasia

Chronic GastritisPathogenesis: 1.Autoimmune gastritis (Type A; “autoimmune”)–auto-antibodies to parietal cells–leads to gland destruction and mucosal atrophy–leads to deficiency of intrinsic factor–can often lead to pernicious anemia2.Chronic Helicobacter pylori (Type B; “bacteria”)

Chronic gastritis: Clinical Features•few or 
no symptoms•upper abdominal discomfort •nausea and 
vomiting •hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria 
•
pernicious anemia in autoimmune gastritis•Risk of development of 
peptic ulcer and  gastric 
carcinoma

Intrinsic factor and Vitamin B12•Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein with which vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) must combine to be absorbed by the gut. •Intrinsic factor is secreted by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa, where it binds with the vitamin. •Bound, intrinsic factor protects vitamin B12 from digestion as it passes through the gastrointestinal tract •Absorption in the ileum •Vitamin B12 is necessary for red blood cell maturation. •A lack of intrinsic factor results in inadequate absorption of the vitamin and cause pernicious anemia.

Causes of Vit B12 deficiency•Surgery: Stomach, Ileum•Nutritional: lack of eggs, meat, dairy•Chronic autoimmune gastritis•Malabsorption: Crohn disease

This picture shows large, dense, oversized, red blood cells (RBCs) that
are seen in megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia can occur when
there is a deficiency of vitamin B-12.


Chronic gastritis

The Helicobacter pylori story

Action of Helicobacter pylori in the development of chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration


Helicobacter pylori gastritis•A Steiner silver stain demonstrates the numerous 
darkly 
stained
 
Helicobacter 
organisms along the luminal surface of the gastric epithelial cells

Electron photomicrograph of Helicobacter pylori colonizing the stomach of a human volunteer who ingested the
organism as part of an experimental inoculation. The spiral microaerophilic bacteria live in the mucus layer that
overlays the gastric epithelium.



H. Pylori chronic gastritis: Morphology•variable gland loss and mucosal atrophy•Intestinal metaplasia (increases risk for adenocarcinoma)•proliferation of lymphoid tissue (increased risk for MALToma•Inflammatory cells

Peptic Ulcers

Peptic Ulcers
•
Definition:
 Chronic, solitary, lesions that occur in any portion of GI tract exposed to aggressive action of acid-peptic juices•most often diagnosed in middle-aged to older adults•may heal after a period of weeks to months of active disease•In the US, the lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcer is ~ 10%•Duodenal ulcers are more frequent in patients with H pylori, blood grp O, Z-E syndrome, cirrhosis, COPD

•H. pylori infection (10% - 20% of individuals with H. pylori develop it)•NSAIDs: Inhibition of mucous prostaglandin synthesis •Cigarette smoking•Alcoholic cirrhosis, increased incidence•Corticosteroids in high dose and with repeated use •Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: –multiple peptic ulcerations in stomach, duodenum, jejunumdue to excess gastrin secretion by a benign pancreatic tumor(a gastrin secreting adenoma called a gastrinoma)
Peptic Ulcers: Causes

Peptic Ulcers: Pathogenesis•~ 98% of peptic ulcers are in the first portion of 
duodenum or in the 
stomach, in a ratio of about 4:1•mucosal exposure to gastric acid and pepsin

•
Gastric ulcer: breach in the mucosa of the alimentary tract that extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa or deeper
•
Gastric erosions: breach in the epithelium of 
the 
mucosa only–Erosions may heal within days–healing of ulcers takes much longer

defects in the mucosa that penetrate at least into the 
submucosa, and 
muscularis
 
propria
 
or deeper•Most are round, sharply punched-out craters 2 to 4 cm in diameter •Ulcers in the duodenum tend to be smaller
•
Favored sites are:
–anterior and posterior walls of the first portion of duodenum –the 
lesser curvature of the stomach

Peptic ulcer of the duodenum: 
the ulcer is small (2 cm) and unlike cancerous ulcers, 
the margins are not elevated


Peptic ulcer of the stomach: demarcated edge, 
radiating 
mucosal folds; margins are not elevated


•In chronic, open peptic ulcer, 4 zones can be distinguished:

Microscopically, the ulcer aa is sharply ‘demarcated, with
normal gastric mucosa on the left falling away into a deep
ulcer whose base contains infamed, necrotic debris. An
arterial branch at the ulcer base is eroded and bleeding.
