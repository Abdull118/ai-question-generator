Congenital Small Intestine Disorders•Duodenal Atresia•Meckel Diverticulum 

Small IntestineDUODENAL ATRESEIA
•Congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum. •It causes polyhydramnios during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies.•Radiography shows a distended stomach and distended duodenum – double-bubble sign.

Small IntestineMECKEL DIVERTICULUM 
•True Diverticulum = Outpouching of all three layers of the bowel wall •Meckel = Most common True diverticulum •Failure of the Vitelline duct to involute •RULE OF 2s1. 2% of population 2. 2 inches long, located in ilium 3.Within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve4.Presents in first 2 years of life with bleeding, volvulus, intussusception, or obstruction5. 2x more common in males •May have ectopic gastric mucosa or pancreatic tissue https://goo.gl/images/NtmdeP 

Small Intestinal Obstruction•Hernias•Adhesions•Volvulus •Intussusception 


Small intestineHERNIAS•Any weakness or defect in abdominal wall may permit protrusion of a serosa-lined pouch of peritoneum à hernia sac •Acquired = anterior hernias•Inguinal•Femoral •Umbilicus•Surgical scars •Most frequent cause of intestinal obstruction worldwide •Stasis and edema can increase the bulk of the herniated loop(s) of bowel leading to permanent entrapment (incarceration) and overtime arterial and venous compromise (strangulation) and infarction 

Small IntestineADHESIONS •Causes:•Surgical procedures•Infection•Peritoneal inflammation (peritonitis, endometriosis) •Fibrous bridging between loops of bowel create closed loops through which other visceral my become entrapped – internal herniation•Adhesions are the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in the US

Small IntestineVOLVULUS•Twisting of loop of bowel about its mesenteric point of attachment•Both luminal and vascular compromise•Obstruction and infarction•Most common in the sigmoid colon followed by the cecum, small bowel, stomach and rarely transverse colon 

Small IntestineINTUSSUSCEPTION
•Occurs when a proximal segment of the intestine telescopes forward into the immediately distal segment•Once trapped the invaginated segment is propelled by peristalsis and pulls the mesentery along •The most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children younger than 2 years of age•Causes:•Children: Idiopathic, lymphoid hyperplasia (e.g., due to rotavirus); usually arises in the terminal ileum, leading to intussusception into the cecum•In adults: tumor•Contrast enemas can be used both diagnostically and therapeutically (also air enemas) for idiopathic cases https://goo.gl/images/1JIuke 

Small Intestine – Malabsorption Disorders•Celiac Disease •Tropical Sprue •Whipple Disease 

Small IntestineCELIAC DISEASE 
•Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy •Immune-mediated! •Triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing foods•Pathogenesis – •Ingestion of gluten and its pathogenic component GLIADIN •Gliadin is deamidated and is presented by antigen presenting cells via MHC class II •Helper T cells mediate tissue damage via IGN gamma •Epithelial cells secrete IL-15•CD8 Cytotoxic Tissue Damage•Via NKG2D and MIC-A Receptor•B cells secrete IgA antibodies to•Gliadin•Endomysium•tTG 

Small IntestineCELIAC DISEASE 


Small IntestineCELIAC DISEASE •Morphology:1.Increased numbers of intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes•Also increased numbers of plasma cells, mast cells, and eosinophils in upper lamina propria 2.Crypt hyperplasia•Increased crypt mitosis – high cell turnover 3.Villous Atrophy (flattening of villi or blunting of villi!) with loss of mucosal and brush-border surface area 


Small IntestineCELIAC DISEASE•Clinical Presentation: •Children: Abdominal distension, diarrhea, and failure to thrive (malabsorption)•Adults: Chronic diarrhea and bloating•Dermatitis Herpetiformis•Small, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin•Due to IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillae•Resolves with gluten-free diet 

Remember Dermatitis Herpetiformis! 
https://goo.gl/images/x6XRaS 
https://goo.gl/images/lsX8S0 IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillaSmall, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin
IgA antibodiesagainst gluten-tissue transglutaminase cross-react with epidermal transglutaminase Deposition of IgA and epidermal TG complexes in the papillary dermis cause the lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis.

Small IntestineCELIAC DISEASE•Lab Findings:1.IgA antibodies against endomysium, tTG, or gliadin •IgG antibodies are also present and are useful for diagnosis in individuals with IgA deficiency (increased incidence of IgA deficiency is seen in celiac disease).2.Duodenal biopsy reveals flattening of villi, hyperplasia of crypts, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Damage is most prominent In the duodenum; jejunum and ileum are less involved

Small IntestineTROPICAL SPRUE •Environmental enteropathy•Prevalent in developing countries or populations with poor sanitation and hygiene•Malabsorption, malnutrition, stunted growth, defective gut immunity •Intestinal Biopsy similar to advanced celiac disease•Underlying cause is UNKNOWN•Defective intestinal barrier function, chronic exposure to fecal pathogens, and repeated bouts of diarrhea within the first 2-3 years of life are likely involved 

Small IntestineWHIPPLE DISEASE •Systemic tissue damage characterized by macrophages loaded with Tropheryma whippelii organisms•partially destroyed organisms are present in macrophage lysosomes (positive for PAS)•Caucasian men, farms, soil/animal exposure •Diarrhea, weight loss and arthralgia•The malabsorptive diarrhea of Whipple disease is due to imparied lymphatic transport •Macrophages compress lacteals•Chylomicrons cannot be transferred from enterocytes to lymphatics•Results in fat malabsorption and steatorrhea•Classic site of involvement is the small bowel lamina propria

Small IntestineWHIPPLE DISEASE •Morphology:•Dense accumulation of distended, foamy macrophages in the small intestinal laminal propropia and lymph nodes (causes lymphatic obstruction)•Contain periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)+ granules (lysosomes stuffed with partially digested bacteria!)•Villous Expansion!•Shaggy gross appearance of mucosal surface•Macrophages may accumulate within mesenteric lymph nodes, synovial membranes of affected joints, cardiac valves, and the brain

Congenital Large Intestine Disorder•Hirschsprung Disease 

ColonHIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE•Defective relaxation and peristalsis of rectum and distal sigmoid colon•Associated with Down syndrome•Due to congenital failure of ganglion cells (neural crest-derived) to descend into myenteric and submucosal plexus•Myenteric (Auerbach) plexus is located between the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers of the muscularis propria and regulates motility•Submucosal (Meissner) plexus is located in the submucosa and regulates blood flow, secretions, and absorption

HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE•Clinical features are based on obstruction•Failure to pass meconium•Massive dilatation (megacolon) of bowel proximal to obstruction with risk for rupture•Rectal suction biopsy reveals lack of ganglion cells•Treatment involves resection of the involved bowel; ganglion cells are present in the bowel proximal to the diseased segment.
