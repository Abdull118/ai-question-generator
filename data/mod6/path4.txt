Jaundice & diagnostic testsTipsuda Bahri, MD

Learning  Objectives 1.Define jaundice/icterus (scleral and general types) and cholestasis •Recognize their physical signs and histologic features, respectively 2.Identify causes of pre-hepatic, hepatic, and post-hepatic jaundice •Pre-hepatic: Hemolysis•Hepatic: Liver injury, Cirrhosis•Post-hepatic: Obstruction, includes Gallstones and conditions affecting the biliary tract and/or pancreas3.Recognize and evaluate certain laboratory tests that aid with hepatobiliary dysfunction:•Enzymes: AST, ALT, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase, 5’Nucelotidase•Serum markers: Bilirubin (direct, indirect), albumin, prothrombin (PT), ammonia•Urine: bilirubin, urobilinogen

Scleral icterus/ General jaundice: Yellowing of the eyes & skin; Bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL

Cholestasis•Impaired bile flow within the liver•Retention of  bilirubin, bile salts, and cholesterol within hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, or bile ducts•Due to liver dysfunction or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary obstructionObj#1

CholestasisSigns & Symptoms: •Pruritis (itching) - common•Xanthomas, Xanthalesma -Cholesterol elevation due to decreased bile salt formation; accumulation within dermis•Decreased fat soluble Vit E,D,K, A absorption (in this order):üVit E: Periph neuropathy, hemolysisüVit D: Osteomalacia, ricketsüVit K: CoagulopathyüVit A: Vision loss; Epithelial metaplasia; Not commonly presentObj#1

Causes of jaundice•Pre-hepatic: Hemolysis•Hepatic: Liver injury, Cirrhosis•Post-hepatic: Obstructive: üGallstonesüConditions affecting the biliary tract and/or pancreas (i.e. PBC, PSC, Cholangitis, Acute cholecystitis)Obj#2

Obj#2

AST, ALT•AST and ALT are the primary enzyme (transaminase) markers of diffuse liver cell injury/necrosis- Usuallynotincreased with focal liver cell necrosis (e.g., metastasis, granulomas)•ALT is more specific for liver than AST•AST is primarily located in hepatocyte mitochondriaüAlcohol is a toxin and disrupts mitochondrial function•AST is also present in red blood cellsüCan be elevated with red cell hemolysisObj#3

Goljan & Slojka  Table 9-17. Summary of Liver Function TestsTestSignificanceLiver cell necrosisSerum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)•Specific enzyme for liver cell necrosis•Present in the cytosol•ALT > AST: viral hepatitisSerum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)•Reflects mitochondria damage•AST > ALT indicates alcoholic hepatitis {ratio > 2:1}Obj#3

Goljan & Slojka  Table 16-2. Laboratory Evaluation of Liver DiseaseTest CategoryCommon Serum TestsBiliary excretory functionSerum bilirubin•Total: unconjugated plus conjugated•Direct: conjugated only; • Indirect: unconjugated (calculation)Urine bilirubin, urobilinogenPlasma membrane enzymes (from damage to bile canaliculus)•Serum alkaline phosphatase•Serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)•Serum 5'-nucleotidaseObj#3

Goljan & Slojka  Table 9-17. Summary of Liver Function TestsTestSignificanceBilirubin excretionCB < 20%Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia: e.g., extravascular hemolytic anemias, Gilbert's syndromeCB 20-50%Mixed hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., viral hepatitis)CB > 50%Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., liver cholestasis, obstruction)CB, conjugated bilirubin; UBG, urobilinogen; UCB, unconjugated bilirubin Obj#3

Wait!How does conjugated bilirubin get into the bloodstream?Isn’t it excreted from bile canaliculi/ducts into the GI tract?

Recall this image from the review lecture:
Obj#3

This is what happens with obstructive jaundice:
Tight junctionObj#3Passive reflux:•Obstruction  (intra- or extra-hepatic) would cause increased pressure•This would overcome the resistance of tight junctions between hepatocytes•No basement membrane to divide hepatocytes from endothelial cells•Conjugated bilirubin would “flow back” into the blood stream

Serum GGT•Source: Hepatocyte smooth ER (same location as cytochrome p450)•Causes for increased GGT level:•Obstructive jaundice (intra- and extrahepatic types) •Excellent marker of obstruction similar to ALP (Alk Phos)•Drug ("induction") of the cytochrome P-450 system •Excellent marker of alcohol ingestion Obj#3

Serum GGT•Useful in differentiating source of increased ALP •Both enzymes (Alk phos & GGT) are increased in intrahepatic and extrahepatic obstruction•Normal GGT with increased ALP indicates that ALP is not of liver originObj#3

Goljan & Slojka  Table 9-17. Summary of Liver Function TestsTestSignificanceCholestasisSerum γ-glutamyl-transferase (GGT)Intra- or extrahepatic obstruction to bile flowInduction of cytochrome P-450 system (e.g., alcohol): increases GGTSerum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)Normal GGT and increased ALP: source of ALP other than liver (e.g., osteoblastic activity in bone)Increased GGT and ALP: liver cholestasisObj#3
