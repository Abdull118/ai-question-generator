Case #1A 5 year old boy is brought to the emergency department for vomiting, and lethargy. He had skin vesicles that erupted on the trunk 4 days ago. He had a fever of 100 F. The mother had given him aspirin to help reduce the fever Pulse 60/min, resp 25/min, irregPE: Fundoscopic exam shows papilledema; No scleral icterusChest: Normal heart sounds, Lungs clearAbd: mildly palpable liver edge


Case #1Labs:AST  100 U/L  (NL: 8-20 U/L)ALT   120 U/L  (Nl: 8-20 U/L)Total bilirubin 1 mg /dL (Nl: 0.2-1 mg/dl) Direct bilirubin: 0.2 (Nl: 0.0-0.3 mg/dl)HCO3 20 (Nl: 22-28 mEq/L)Ammonia  230 microgm/dL (Nl: 15-45 microgm/dL)Fasting glucose 60 mg/dL (Nl: 70-110 mg/dL) Blood gas: pH   7.24 (Nl: 7.35-7.45)pCO2 38 mm Hg  (Nl: 33-45 mm Hg)pO2 80 mm Hg (Nl: 75-105 mm Hg)

Case #1Diagnosis?What viral illness did this child most likely have?What contributed to the papilledema?What would most likely be seen in the liver?Obj#2

Case #1: Reyes syndrome= Toxic metabolic encephalopathy•Recent viral illness (Influenza A, B, or Varicella)•Clinical manifestations: •Symptoms start 3-5 days after viral illness•Progression in following orderüEmesisüLethargyüConfusionüSeizuresüComaObj#2

Case #1: Reyes syndromeOther clinical manifestations:üLiver failureüIncreased intracranial pressureüCushing’s triad: bradycardia, irregular breathing, widened pulse pressure•Aspirin should not be given to kids; after age 19 is recommendedObj#2

Case #1: Reyes syndromePathophysiologic mechanism•Aspirin is metabolized to salicylate•High concentration of salicylate carried to liver•Metabolites are formed in hepatocyte mitochondria•Higher salicylates cause 1.slower removal from cell2.inhibits beta-oxidation of fatty acid metabolism•Also, viral illness also alters the metabolism of fatty acidsObj#2

Obj#2

Obj#2

Centrilobular necrosis:Acetominophen toxicityMechanism is complex:1.Zone 3 has more cytochrome P450 activity, so increased amount of drug metabolite which depletes glutathione2.Decreased glutathione production leads to increased oxidative stress and cell injury 3.Increased mitochondrial permeability & decreased ATP Obj#2

Occupational exposure:Dry cleaning (slide added after videotaping)Carbon tetrachloride•Cytochrome P450 converts CCl4 to Cl3- free radical- leads to membrane peroxidation•Damage to liver, kidney, brain•Centrilobular necrosis

Case #2A 35 year old male presents to the emergency department complaining of malaise, fatigue, and general abdominal pain. He has a history of depression and alcohol use.Pulse 90/min, resp 16/min, Temp 98.6 CPE: No icterus or jaundiceChest: Normal heart sounds, Lungs clearAbd: mildly palpable liver edge

Case #2Labs:AST  800 U/L  (NL: 8-20 U/L)ALT   400 U/L  (Nl: 8-20 U/L)Total bilirubin 1 mg/dL (Nl: 0.2-1 mg/dl) Direct bilirubin: 0.2 mg/dL (Nl: 0.0-0.3 mg/dl)

Case #2What is the early histologic sign of alcoholic use? SteatosisWhat is the pathophysiologic mechanism of this hepatocellular change? •EtOH increases NADH/NAD+ in hepatocytes•Fatty acid oxidation is disrupted•Large vacuoles of triglycerides accumulate within cellsIs this change reversible?Yes, with abstinence


Steatosis morphology With accumulation, the organ enlarges and becomes progressively yellow, greasy & soft.


Case #2What is the histologic sign of alcoholic hepatitis?•Swollen hepatocytes•Neutrophilic infiltration•Mallory bodies

Cell injury: Reversible


Ballooning degeneration= cell swelling; reversible cell injury


Alcoholic hepatitis: •The cluster of inflammatory cells marks the site of a necrotic hepatocyte (bottom) •Mallory-Denke body is present in a second hepatocyte (arrow, top)


Necrosis/ Accumulations: Mallory-Denke bodies = cytoskeletal (cytokeratin) remnants;Seen with alcoholic hepatitis & others


Case #2B: NAFLDWhat is the difference between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic steatosis and?NAFLD: •NO history/use of alcohol•HISTORY of metabolic syndrome •Obesity causes fatty infiltration in liver, which can lead to inflammation, necrosis•Asymptomatic•Can have elevated AST


Alcoholic Hepatitis
: 
Clinical Features•~ 15-20 yrs of excessive drinking •women more susceptible than men•daily ingestion >160 g •Malaise, anorexia, weight loss•RUQ discomfort, tender hepatomegaly, and fever •Elevated ALT and AST levels Hyperbilirubinemia, elevated ALP•Neutrophilic leukocytosis•10% to 20% risk of death•Cirrhosis appears in ~33% of patients within a few years

Alcoholic cirrhosis:A. The characteristic 
diffuse 
nodularity of the surface reflects the interplay between nodular regeneration and scarringB. The microscopic view shows nodules of varying sizes


Case #3A 35 year old male presents to the emergency department complaining of malaise, fatigue, and general yellow discoloration of the skin. He has a history of depression and alcohol use. He is sexually active and does not use protection all the time.Pulse 90/min, resp 16/min, Temp 99.6 CPE: Scleral icterus and generalized jaundiceChest: Normal heart sounds, Lungs clearAbd: mildly tender, palpable liver edge

HBV infection: Ground glass hepatocytes


Inflammation
Limiting plate = region between acinus & portal triad•Example: Hepatitis (viral, autoimmune, alcoholic) •Causes inflammation that may be limited to the portal triads•If the inflammation breaks the limiting plate, then there can be hepatocyte involvement

ApoptosisExecution of apoptosis:•Mediated by caspases:–digest nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins –activate endonucleases

Apoptosis


Avoiding apoptosis
• Cancer cells• Oncogenic viruses: Can inactivate p53Ø Examples: Hepatitis B virus, HIV, EBV, HPV

Apoptotic bodies: Nicely packaged & ready for disposal by roaming macrophagesFig 3-19 Ross & Pawlina

Apoptosis: Councilman bodiesSeen with viral hepatitis

Objectives3.Discuss and distinguish the pathogenic mechanism, morphology, and clinical manifestation of other causes or  hepatitis and cirrhosis•Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency•Wilson disease•Hemochromatosis, primary versus secondary

Case #1A 24 year old male presents to his physician with progressive dyspnea and cough. The dyspnea is worsened with exertion. He has a 0.5 pack per day tobacco smoking historyPulse 80/min, resp 23/min, Temp 98.6 CPE: Scleral icterus Normal heart sounds Chest: Lungs, hyperresonantAbd: mildly palpable liver edge

Case #1Pulmonary function test reveals a prolonged expiratory time; FEV1 is 75% of predictedFEV1/FVC is 0.6 (decreased)Genetic testing revealed homozygous ZZ genotypeWhat lung condition does this patient have? Emphysema: lack of AAT to inhibit neutrophil elastaseWhat would a liver biopsy find?

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency; PAS-positive granulesMisfolded protein accumulation


Case #2A 32 year old male presents with writhing, jerky movements, excess drooling and joint pain. Pulse 76/min, resp 16/min, Temp 98.6 CPE: Eyes: discoloration of the corneaNormal heart sounds Chest: Lungs clearAbd: mildly palpable liver edgeNeurologic: Loss of coordination, Drooling, and extrapyramidal tremors


Case #2CT scan: negativeMRI: hypodense lesions in the basal ganglia, bilaterallyLabs:•Elevated total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST, ALT•Normal alkaline phosphatase, GGT•Decreased ceruloplasmin Diagnosis? Wilson diseaseWhat would you find in the urine? Elevated copper levelWhat would a liver biopsy find?

Accumulations: Wilson’s disease= Copper


Case #2: Wilson disease•Autosomal recessive inheritance; ATP7B gene•Mutation in the copper transporting ATPase•Patients have normal ingestion of copper•Decreased copper excretion in bile •Decreased incorporation  of copper to apoceruloplasmin (to form ceruloplasmin)•Copper accumulation: Brain, liver, cornea, kidney

Case #2: Wilson disease•Presentation before age 40 years•Brain: tremors, Parkinsonism, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders•Joints: degenerative arthritis•Kayser-Fleischer rings: copper in Descemet’s membrane•Liver: hepatitis, cirrhosis

Case #3A 34 year old male complains of progressive joint pain and decreased libido for the past 2 years. Pulse 76/min, resp 16/min, Temp 98.6 CPE: Skin: not jaundice, but brown-tan colorationNormal heart sounds Chest: Lungs clearAbd: mildly palpable liver edgeLabs: Hypoglycemia

Case #3 Liver biopsy: HemosiderinPrussian blue (iron) stain


Case #3Diagnosis? HemochromatosisCauses?•Primary:  Mutation in the HFE gene (involved with hepcidin regulation)§Hepcidin normally down-regulates iron absorption§Leads to dysregulation and maximal transfer of iron from gut into plasma•Secondary: Blood transfusions or excess iron ingestion

Case #3: HemochromatosisTriad:•Skin pigmentation•Hepatomegaly•Diabetes mellitus•Decreased libido: deposition in testes -> hypogonadism
