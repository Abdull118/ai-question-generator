Cirrhosis, Liver failure, and Portal hypertensionTipsuda Bahri, MD


Objectives1.Evaluate the causes, mechanism, and morphology of cirrhosis2.Recognize the clinical manifestations of liver failure and portal hypertension

Cirrhosis•=End-stage liver disease•Disruption of liver architecture by fibrosis and regenerative nodules•Leads to micro- and macronodular cirrhosis* By end stage, mixed nodule sizesObj#1

Liver fibrosis
Obj#1

Nodular Cirrhosis
Obj#1

Regenerative nodules in cirrhosis (trichrome stain)
Obj#1

Bile duct proliferation= stem cells proliferate in response to injury/ inflammation
Obj#1

Ascites•Increased resistent to portal blood flow•Due to intra-, pre- or post-hepatic conditions
Obj#2

Liver failure•Occurs with loss of 80-90% of liver function•Causes: § Acute (fulminant) liver failureØ Due to drugs: Acetaminophen, Halothane, Isoniazid, Rifampin, MAO InhibitorsØ Due to toxins: Carbon tetrachloride, Aminata mushroom poisoningØ Due to viral infection: HAV, HBV, HCV (rare)Ø Due to autoimmune hepatitisObj#2

Liver failure•Causes (cont’d):§ Chronic liver disease  (“end point”)§ Hepatic dysfunction without overt necrosisØCells are viable, but dysfunctionalØTetracycline toxicity and Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Obj#2

Liver failure: Clinical features•Jaundice•Hypoalbuminemia•Coagulopathy•Hyperammonemia•Hyperestrogenemia (Men): Hypogonadism, Gynecomastia, •Palmar erythema (Vasodilation)•Spider angiomas: Dilated arterioles•Fetor hepaticus:  body odorObj#2

Spider angioma
Obj#2

Gynecomastia
Obj#2

Liver failure: Clinical complications•Hepatic encephalopathy§Complication of acute and chronic liver failureØAcute setting: Elevated blood ammoniaØChronic setting: Altered amino acid metabolism§Neurologic signs: Confusion, Stupor, Coma, Rigidity, Hyper-reflexia§Asterixis = flapping tremor of handsObj#2

Portal hypertension•Increased resistent to portal blood flow•Due to intra-, pre- or post-hepatic conditions•Shunts:…???
Obj#2

Consequence of portal HTN
Obj#2

Additional conditionsHepatorenal syndrome§Renal failure, oliguria: Sodium retention, decreased perfusion/GFR, impaired water excretion§Mechanism UNK§Need to exclude toxic or circulatory collapse that can affect both liver and kidney§Treat underlying liver disease

Additional conditions•Portopulmonary hypertension§Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with liver disease§Excess vasoconstriction and right sided heart failure•Hepatopulmonary syndrome§Hypoxemia & intra-pulmonary vascular dilation§Increased dyspnea on exertion, decreased O2 saturation§Ventilation/perfusion mismatch
