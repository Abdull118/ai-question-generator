Terminology•Cholelithiasis (gallstones) •Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct) •Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation)

Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)Two main types of gallstones:1.Cholesterol stones ~ 80% •containing cholesterol •Yellow2.Pigment stones •containing bilirubin calcium salts (unconjugated bilirubin)•Brown or Black Obj #1

Cholesterol lithiasis: Risk factors•Demography: Northern Europe, North and South America•Genetics: Native American, Alaskan native•Advancing age•Female sex hormones: female gender, oral contraceptives, pregnancy•Obesity and rapid weight reduction•Gallbladder stasis•Inborn disorders of bile acid metabolism•Hyperlipidemia syndromesObj #1

Cholelithiasis 
Obj #1

Pigmented Cholelithiasis: Risks•Demography: Asian more than Western, rural more than urban•Chronic hemolysis, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia•Biliary infection•Gastrointestinal disorders: ileal disease (e.g., Crohn disease), ileal resection or bypass, cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiencyObj #1

Pigmented gallstones: Brown (L) and Black (R) gallstones
Cause: InfectionCause: Chronic hemolysis

Gallstones: Clinical Features •Asymptomtic in 80% of patients •Biliary colic/ pain: RUQ; constant, "colicky" •Radiolucent: Cholesterol and brown stones•Radiopaque: Black•Complications: ü Cholecystitisü Empyemaü Perforation, fistulaeü Obstructive cholestasis, choledocholithiasis,  or pancreatitisü Intestinal obstruction (gallstone ileitis)Obj #1

•For Diagnosis:•Ultrasonography: •detection of gallstones •dilatation of the bile ducts •thickened gallbladder wall(try to avoid surgery during an acute attack)
Obj #1

Cholecystitis •Inflammation of the gallbladder •Mainly  occurs in association with gallstones•Three types:1.Acute2.Chronic3.Acute superimposed on chronicObj #2

Acute Calculous Cholecystitis •Acute inflammation of gallbladder that contains stones •Obstruction of the gallbladder neck or cystic duct
Obj #2

Acute Calculous Cholecystitis Clinical Features: •Fever, nausea, leukocytosis•Right upper abdominal colicky pain (biliary colic), radiating to right shoulder •Tender right subcostal region•Mild attacks subside spontaneously over 1 to 10 days•Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia •Recurrence is commonObj #2

Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis
 •~ 12% of acute cholecystitis contain no gallstonesCauses:  Stasis•Postoperative, after major surgery•Severe trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents)•Severe burns•Sepsis•symptoms can be hidden by other severe clinical conditionsObj #2

Chronic Cholecystitis•Due to repeated bouts of acute cholecystitis•Always associated with gallstonesClinical Features: •Recurrent attacks of either steady or colicky right upper quadrant pain•Nausea, vomiting•Intolerance of fatty foods (bile is needed to emulsify fats)Complication:•Fibrosis and calcification of gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder)•Increased risk for gallbladder carcinomaObj #2
