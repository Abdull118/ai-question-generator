Vascular disorders of the liver 

Hepatic Circulatory Disorders 
Obj#1

Liver infarcts are rare,but can occurDefinition: Focal ischemic injury•Liver has a dual blood supply (80% portal vein, 20% hepatic artery)•Usually from occlusion of  intrahepatic branch of hepatic arteryDiffers from ischemic hepatitis (global ischemia due to shock, hypoxia; 50% of patients can develop hepatopulmonary syndrome)Obj#1

Liver infarctsCauses:•Iatrogenic ligation of the hepatic artery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy)•Hepatic artery embolization•Thrombosis: atherosclerosis, hypercoag states, liver transplant•Other: Toxemia of pregnancy, Vasculitis, Cocaine toxicity, Aortic dissectionObj#1

Liver infarctsClinical manifestations:•Look for the history of potential causes•Usually asymptomatic•Severe symptoms: fever, RUQ  or epigasteric pain, back pain, jaundice, nausea, vomitingDiagnosis:•Radiographic imaging or ultrasoundObj#1

Liver infarcts

Chronic passive congestion •Seen with heart failure•Back up of blood (passive congestion) from heart
Obj#2

Classic “nutmeg” appearance:Chronic passive congestion

Atlas of PathologyObj#2

Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari Syndrome)•Definition: Thrombotic occlusion of hepatic veins•Characterized by:•Hepatomegaly•Ascites •Abdominal pain•ABSENT JVDObj#2

Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari Syndrome)Causes:•polycythemia vera (increased viscosity)•pregnancy, oral contraceptives (hypercoagulable states)•paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria•intra-abdominal cancers i.e. hepatocellular carcinoma•idiopathic ~30% of cases

Budd-Chiari syndrome: Thrombosis of the major hepatic veins has caused extreme blood retention in the liver. the liver is swollen, is red-purple, and has a tense capsule 
Obj#2

1.Benign: •Cysts  (Polycystic kidney disease, simple)•Cavernous hemangiomas•most common benign lesions •Focal nodular hyperplasia•nodular regeneration in response to vascular injury•Hepatic AdenomasHepatic Tumors
Obj#3

Simple cyst of the liver
Obj#3

Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (DPKD)Numerous cysts appear in this liver from a patient with polycystic kidney disease     
Obj#3

Hemangioma•Benign tumor or proliferation of blood vessels•Dilated vascular channels§ Usually congenital, common in the liver§   One of the most common of benign tumors §Subcapsular location  §Fragile; can bleed•Biopsy contraindicated; Recommend excisionObj#3

Benign hemangioma of the liver just beneath the capsule. 
Obj#3

Microscopy: Cavernous hemangioma
Obj#3

Focal nodular hyperplasia•Benign proliferation of hepatocytes•Associated with oral contraceptive use•Seen predominantly in young women or pregnancy•Can bleed due to increased vacularityObj#3

Focal nodular hyperplasia-  central scar (arrows)
Obj#3

Hepatic adenoma•Benign tumor of hepatocytesSimilar to Focal nodular hyperplasia:•Strongly associated with oral contraceptive, anabolic steroid use•Seen predominantly in young women or pregnancy•Can bleed due to increased vacularityObj#3

Hepatic adenoma
Obj#3

2.Malignant:•Metastatic cancer  (most common) •Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)•Cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile duct)•Hepatic angiosarcoma3. Gallbladder carcinomaHepatic Tumors
Obj#3

Metastatic carcinomasThe most common of all hepatic neoplasms; from colon, pancreas, lung, skin, and breast primaries 
Obj#3

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)•M > F•Etiologic associations:üCirrhosis üInfection with HBV, HCV (increases with alcohol)üCarcinogens (Aflatoxins) üHemochromatosisüAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiencyObj#3

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)Gross morphologies:1.Unifocal, usually massive tumor 2.Multifocal, widely distributed nodules of variable size3.Diffusely infiltrative, may involve the entire liver4.   HCCs have a strong tendency for vascular invasionObj#3

Hepatocellular carcinoma, unifocal, massive typeA large neoplasm with extensive areas of necrosis has replaced most of the right hepatic lobe in this non-cirrhotic liver

Hepatocellular carcinoma, 
multifocal

Hepatocellular carcinoma

HCC: Clinical Features•silent hepatomegaly•bloody ascites•elevated serum levels of α-fetoprotein§α-fetoprotein lacks specificity    §If > 1000 ng/mL, it is HCC §Elevated levels also seen with yolk sac tumors•Median survival is 6 monthsObj#3

Cancers of the extrahepatic biliary tract1.Cancer arising in the ducts•Cholangiocarcinomas: adenocarcinomas of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts2.Carcinoma of the Gallbladder •adenocarcinomasObj#3

Cholangiocarcinomas•well-differentiated adenocarcinomas•tendency for extrahepatic spread
Obj#3

Cholangiocarcinoma- Increased incidence with Chronic liver fluke (Clonorchis) infection & Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)


Malignant variant of a hemangioma = Hepatic angiosarcoma
Obj#3

Hepatic angiosarcoma & Vinyl chloride Cause: •Exposure to vinyl chloride, a precursor in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (a plastic used in car seat covers) caused an epidemic of hepatic angiosarcomas•Other: arsenic (pesticides), thorotrast dyeObj#3

Angiosarcoma
Obj#3

Gallbladder adenocarcinoma: The opened gallbladder contains a large, exophytic tumor that virtually fills the lumen
