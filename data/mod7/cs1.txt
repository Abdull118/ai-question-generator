organ systems

variable, regardless of age 
of the patientMARFAN SYNDROME: CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

excavatum or carinatum , scoliosis, joint 
hypermobility, highly arched palate,

stress(neck, groin, popliteal and cubital 
fossae), periumbilical, buccal mucosa;

hypermobile joints (most common) ,

appearance, sagging jowls, hooked  
nose with everted nostrils, everted

IMPERFECTA
•Autosomal dominant (rare 
recessive forms exist)
•Type I most common
•Decreased production of type I 
collagen
•1:20,000 births
•Often confused with child 
abuse
•Spectrum of severity
–Lethal prenatally (type II) – 
mild features (type I)OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA
•Signs and symptoms
–Multiple fractures with minimal trauma (including 
during birth), blue sclerae , hearing loss, dental 
issues
–Osteochondrodysplasia seen with recessive forms

OSTEOGENESIS 
IMPERFECTA
•Diagnosis
–Analysis of collagen from 
cultured skin fibroblasts
–DNA analysis
•Treatment
–Daily risedronate in children
–Surgical stabilization of long 
bones (intramedullary rods)AMYLOIDOSIS
•Primary (AL)
–Due to deposition of proteins 
from immunoglobulin light 
chains
–Either plasma cell disorder or 
multiple myeloma
–Affects multiple organ systems
•Secondary (AA)
–Amyloid A
–Chronic inflammatory 
conditions
–MultisystemAMYLOIDOSIS
•Signs and symptoms
–Primary: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive 
cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, easy 
bruising, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, 
neuropathy, macroglossia only present in 
AL
•Diagnosis: biopsy of subcutaneous fat 
with Congo red staining, establish type, 
rule out multiple myeloma
•Treatment: traditional chemo or high 
dose chemo with stem cell 
transplantation
