Some slides adapted from original  2014 and 2016 lectures by Marshall Kurtz, D.O. and Conrad Fischer, MDObjectives
•Identify cerebrovascular anatomy
•Define stroke (cerebrovascular accident) 
and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
•Define and categorize types and 
subtypes of stroke (CVA).
•Identify risk factors for stroke (CVA).
•Discuss clinical presentation, work-up 
and treatment of stroke (CVA).
•Identify clinicoanatomical correlates of 
each stroke. (i.e., how to localize a 
stroke based on clinical presentation)
•Discuss primary and secondary stroke 
prevention.Reading

the Brainstem  (Int Med J 2005;

Extracranial Arterial Circulation
Internal Carotid 
Artery:
•Arises off 
common carotid 
artery
•Carotid bulb 
major location of 
atherosclerotic 
plaque
•Feeds ACA, MCA, 
PCA & multiple 
penetrating 
branches
•Carotid sinus
Circle of Willis
Stroke
(Cerebrovascular Accident/Syndrome)
Clinical syndrome with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit that is 
attributable to a focal vascular cause causing ischemia & cell death.
•Neurological deficits persist beyond 24 hours
•Brain imaging used to confirm clinical suspicion  
•Analogous to Acute Coronary Syndrome → brain cell death due to ischemia
Two types of CVAs 
1.Ischemic (80-85%)
•atherosclerosis (thrombotic)
•cardiogenic embolism 
(embolic)
•systemic hypoperfusion 
(water shed areas most 
affected)
2.Hemorrhagic (15-20%)
•e.g., SAH, epidural, 
intracerebral, etc.Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
•Brief neurological 
dysfunction from 
cerebral ischemia 
•All neurologic signs 
& symptoms 
resolve within 24 
hour without 
evidence of brain 
infarction on brain 
imaging
•Often warning sign 
of future CVA
•Think “angina” of 
the brain
Risk Factors for Stroke
Controllable
•Tobacco
•Exercise
•High Blood Pressure
•Atrial Fibrillation
•High Cholesterol
•Diabetes
•Atherosclerosis
Uncontrollable
•Age
•Previous Stroke or 
TIA
•Fibromuscular 
Dysplasia
•Patent Foramen 
Ovale/ASDWork Up of CVA
Remember the cause:
•If trauma think bleed!
•Reduction of blood supply to the brain
•Focal (occlusion of a single artery)
•Multifocal (related to occlusion of several 
arteries)
•Diffuse (systemic hypotension)
•History & clinical findings/exam
•ABC’s
•Ischemic strokes can often be localized 
anatomically by exam
•Brain Imaging
•CT scan (best to rule out bleed quickly)
•MRI
•Other
•ECG, CBC, pulse oximetry
•PT/PTT or other if on anticoagulation
•Metabolic work up (electrolytes, LFT’s, etc.)
•EEG, Carotid US, ECHO etc.

Syndromes
Hold on to your hat….Basilar Artery
Branches of the basilar artery 
supply the base of the pons and 
superior cerebellum
Divided into three groups: 
1.Paramedian
•supply a wedge of pons on either 
side of the midline
2.Short circumferential
•supply the lateral ⅔ of the pons & 
the middle & superior cerebellar 
peduncles
3.Bilateral long circumferential 
(superior cerebellar & anterior inferior 
cerebellar arteries)
•course around the pons to supply 
the cerebellar hemispheres
Basilar Artery
An occlusion of these groups 
of vessels results in two 
distinct types of brainstem 
syndromes:
1.Medial (or paramedian) 
brainstem syndromes
•due to para-median branch 
occlusion
2.Lateral brainstem 
syndromes
•due to occlusion of the 
circumferential branches, and 
occasionally with unilateral 
vertebral occlusion
Basilar Artery Stroke
General Findings
•Motor deficits:
•hemiparesis or tetraparesis and 
•facial paresis
•Dysarthria & speech 
impairment
•Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, & 
hiccup (all very common)
•Visual disturbances (e.g. diplopia) 
•CN palsies
•Altered mental status/coma
•Symptoms are often bilateral!!
•Locked-in syndrome

Hemorrhagic Stroke Syndromes
Types Key Concepts
Epidural 
Hematoma•Almost always traumatic & assoc. with skull fracture
•Rupture of the middle meningeal artery
•Lucid interval before loss of consciousness (“talk & die”)
•Treatment: ICP monitoring, Neurosurgery
Subdural 
Hematoma•Usually caused by head trauma in person at risk (elderly, alcoholic, 
anticoagulation, etc.)
•Rupture of bridging veins (connects brain & sagittal sinus)  – slow bleed. (If 
acute can act like an epidural)
•CRESCENT shaped bleeding on CT scan
•Treatment: Depends on symptoms; Neurosurgery
Subarachnoid 
Hemorrhage
(SAH)•Ruptured berry aneurysm is most frequent cause
Other factors: 
•Marfan’s or Ehler’s Danlos type 4 (vascular)
•Adult polycystic kidney disease
•Hypertension
•Smoking
•Treatment: Endovascular coils or Surgical clipping 
Intracerebral 
Hemorrhage•Common Causes: HTN, Trauma, Infarction
•Treatment: ICP monitoring ; Neurosurgical consultation
Inclusion criteria 
for Thrombolytic 
Therapy in 
Ischemic Strokes:
•Clinical diagnosis of 
ischemic stroke causing 
measurable neurologic 
deficit
•Onset of symptoms 
<4.5 hours before 
beginning treatment
•Age ≥18 years
Be aware there are lots of 
exclusion criteria!!Mechanical Thrombectomy
A: Catheter angiogram (AP view) shows a filling defect at the carotid 
terminus of internal carotid artery. B: Normal filling of the anterior 
circulation after complete recanalization following mechanical 
thrombectomy. C: 24-hour MRI showing small residual infarct following 
recanalization. The entire cortex and majority of the white matter has been 
preserved. Source: Thabele Leslie-Mazwi, MD

0 General Criteria
•Neuroimaging with a 
small infarct & 
excludes hemorrhage
•Anterior circulation 
CVA not posterior 
circulation.
•Patient has a 
persistent, potentially 
disabling neurologic 
deficit
•Thrombectomy can be 
started within 24 hours 
of the onset of 
symptoms or the time 
last known to be well
Performed at a stroke 
center with appropriate 
expertise in the use of 
stent retrieversSecondary Stroke 
Prevention
•Based on underlying disease process!!
•e.g., atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, diabetes, carotid artery disease.
•Modifiable Risk Factors:
•Weight reduction
•Smoking cessation
•Increase exercise
•Lower cholesterol
•Medications:
•Low Dose Aspirin
•Lipid lowering agents
•Other:
•Depends on underlying disease process
