Spinal Cord Vasculature
Artery of Adamkiewicz
Left T11 (T9-12) radicular artery
Major blood supply to lower T and L spineUPPER motor neuron
Brain and spinal cord
–Weakness
–Atrophy (less)
–Spasticity
–Hyperreflexia
–Pathological reflexes
LOWER motor neuron
Motor Unit
–Weakness
–Atrophy (more)
–Flaccidity
–Hyporeflexia/areflexiaSpasticity
Defined as resistance to velocity-dependent 
range of motion
Contracture: not velocity-dependent
Imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory 
impulses
Intensity can be affected by painClinical Presentation: Motor Examination
10 key muscles (5 upper & 5 lower ext)
C5- Elbow Flexion L2- Hip Flexion
C6- Wrist Extension L3- Knee Extension
C7- Elbow Extension L4- Ankle Dorsiflexion
C8- Finger Flexion L5- Toe Extension
T1- Finger Abduction S1- Ankle Plantar Flexion
Sacral exam : voluntary anal contraction (present/absent)Clinical Presentation: Sensory Examination
Establish a sensory level
Dermatomes
Nipples:  T4
Umbilicus:  T10
Posterior columns
Vibration
Joint position sense (proprioception)
Spinothalamic tracts
Pain
Temperature
Autonomic Dysfunction
Neurogenic bladder
Urgency, incontinence, retention
Bowel 
Constipation more frequent than 
incontinence
Alteration in sweating below lesion
Neuropathic pain
SexualSpinal Cord Injury
Epidemiology
80-85% males (usually 16-30 y/o), 15-20% female
MV A (45%), falls (18%), violence (17%), sports 
injuries (13%) most common causes
50% of SCI’s are complete
56% of SCI’s are cervical
Immediate mortality for complete cervical SCI ~ 
50%
Fracture/dislocations most common at:
C5-6 > T12-L1 > C1-2Spinal Cord Injury
Spinal Cord Injury
SCI Complications
Autonomic Dysreflexia
Heterotopic ossification
Osteoporosis
Pressure ulceration
Pulmonary: atelectasis, pneumonia
Renal: nephrolithiasis, bladder 
stones, obstructive nephropathy
CardiovascularAutonomic Dysreflexia
Cardiovascular issues
Orthostatic hypotension
Electrolyte imbalances: hyponatremia 
(SIADH)
Arrhythmias
DVT/PE: especially in flaccid injuries
Prevention: mechanical + LMWHHeterotopic Ossification
Excessive bone formation, usually around 
hips
Response to neurologic insult
Ischemia and tissue expression of bone 
morphogenic proteins (BMP).
Amount proportional to degree of limb 
spasticityHeterotopic Ossification
Heterotopic Ossification
Diagnosis
3-phase bone scan highly sensitive 
in early diagnosis 
Vascular blush, increased blood 
pooling about joint
Serum alkaline phosphatase: peak 
2-10 weeks
Nonspecific
X-ray when bone maturesTreatment
NSAIDS in acute inflammatory phase
Bisphosphonates 
Physical therapy: gentle during active 
phase, aggressive therapy can increase HO
Radiation Therapy
Surgical resection when metabolically 
inactive, otherwise recursSpinal Cord Syndromes
Anterior cord syndrome
Posterior cord syndrome
Brown-Sequard syndrome
Conus medullaris/cauda equina 
syndrome
SyringomyeliaAnterior cord syndrome
Anterior spinal artery supplies ventral 2/3 
of spinal cord
Posterior columns preserved 
(proprioception, vibration)
Weakness (corticospinal) and 
pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic)Artery of Adamkiewicz at T10-11
Watershed area
upper thoracic
Loss of motor, pain (sparing of 
proprioception)
Generally poor prognosis for neurologic 
recovery
Posterior cord 
syndrome
Impairment of posterior spinal 
artery to posterior columns
Loss of proprioception (sparing of 
motor & pain)
Poor prognosis for ambulation
Brown-Sequard syndrome
Cord “hemi-section”
Trauma or tumor
Dissociated sensory loss
Loss of pain and temperature contralateral 1-2 
levels below lesion
Loss of vibration/proprioception ipsilateral to the 
lesion 
These pathways cross at the level of the brainstemConus Medullaris Syndrome
Injury to sacral cord / lumbosacral nerve roots
Symmetric (often) complete saddle anesthesia
Bladder and bowel dysfunction
Lower-extremity motor weaknessSyringomyelia
Fluid filled cavitation in the 
center of the cord
Cervical cord most common 
site
Loss of pain and temperature 
related to the crossing fibers 
occurs early
cape like sensory loss
Weakness of muscles in arms 
with atrophy and hyporeflexia 
(AHC)Syringomyelia
Transverse myelitis
Inflammation of the spinal cord 
Post-infectious
Post-vaccinial
Multiple sclerosis
Pain at level of lesion may precede onset 
of weakness/sensory change/bowel & 
bladder disturbance
CSF analysis may help with diagnosisInfections
Polio
only the anterior horn cells are infected
Tabes dorsalis
dorsal root ganglia and dorsal columns are 
involved
tertiary syphilis
sensory ataxia, “lightning pains”
HIV myelopathy
mimics B12 deficiency
HTLV-1 myelopathy - 
tropical spastic paraparesisB12 Deficiency
Subacute combined degeneration of 
the cord
B12 deficiency
Malabsorption of B12 secondary to 
pernicious anemia or surgery
Insufficient dietary intake – vegan diet
Posterior column and corticospinal 
tract involvement with superimposed 
peripheral neuropathyMuscular Dystrophies
Progressive, intrinsic muscle 
disorders
Generally hereditary
Nervous system, NMJ spared
Relentless destruction of muscle 
tissueMuscular Dystrophies
Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy 
(DMD)
X-linked recessive (rare autosomal 
recessive)
1/3 spontaneous mutations, 2/3 inherited
Due to absence of dystrophin
Protein complex that connects cytoskeleton 
of muscle fiber to surrounding extracellular 
matrix
Incidence 1 / 3,500 male births
High CK at birth, weakness noted by 
age 2
Proximal > distal weakness, clumsy gait
Gower’s sign; pseudohypertrophy
Ambulation deterioration variable
Death due to pulmonary insufficiencyMuscular Dystrophies
Gower’s SignMuscular Dystrophies
Pseudohypertrophy of calvesMuscular Dystrophies
Becker’s MD
X-linked recessive disorder
Defective (partially functional) 
dystrophin
Rate of progression slower, walk 
until age 16
Pseudohypertrophy, Achilles 
contractures
Hip/shoulder muscle weakness
Less cardiac involvement
Life expectancy 36-60 yearsBecker’s Muscular Dystrophy
Muscular Dystrophies
Facioscapulohumeral MD
Autosomal dominant
Facial muscles affected first, then 
scapular, pectoral, proximal arm 
(“Popeye” arms); then pelvic 
(Trendelenburg)
Incidence 4 per million; onset age 3-
44
Generally remain ambulatory; 
normal life span
Histology: necrotic, regenerating 
fibers; split fibers, fibrosis.Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy

Scapuloperoneal MD
Autosomal dominant
Scapular and ankle stabilizer 
muscles
Foot drop, scapular winging, trapezius 
hypertrophy
Normal or slightly elevated CK
Emery-Dreifuss MD (subtype): 
slower
Limb-Girdle MD
Autosomal recessive or dominant
Variable presentation
