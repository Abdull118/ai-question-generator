meningitis
Spinal Epidural Abscess: 
Treatment
•Team approach

–Drainage
–Antibiotics
•Empiric antibiotics
–Vancomycin + cefotaxime or 
ceftriaxone or cefipime or 
ceftazidime

oxacillinMeningitis
•Inflammation of the 
arachnoid membrane, pia 
mater and CSF

significantly since 
introduction of vaccines 
against

especially those in close 
quartersBacterial Meningitis 
Causes

processed meats, uncooked 
vegetables, pre-cut salads)
–becoming more common
•Neonates
•Adults over 60
•Immunocompromised
•Alcoholics
•pregnant womenBacterial Meningitis 
Causes
•Coag. negative staph – 
complication of neurosurgery 
procedures
•Strep viridans, Pseudomonas – 
complicates myelography and 
other interventional procedures 
involving the CNS
•Gram negative ( E. coli, 
Klebsiella ) and S. aureus - 
nosocomialBacterial Meningitis
Clinical Presentation
•Headache
•Fever
•Stiff neck
•Change in 
mental 
status
Inability to straighten leg 
when hip flexed to 90 
degrees
Involuntary flexion of 
hip and knee when 
neck is passively 
flexedNeisseria Meningitidis 
Manifestations
Petechial or ecchymotic rash
Waterhouse-Friderichsen 
syndrome – sudden onset of fever, 
petechial hemorrhages, and 
disseminated intravascular 
coagulationBacterial Meningitis Diagnosis
Lumbar puncture
Bacterial Meningitis Diagnosis
•To scan or not to scan?
–MRI or CT
–Based upon neurologic 
findings suspicious for mass 
lesion
•Papilledema
•Focal neurologic signs
–If patient is at risk of brain 
herniation with lumbar 
puncture
•Do not delay empiric 
antibiotic therapy!!!Gram Positive Diplococci – 
S. pneumoniae
Gram Negative Diplococci – N. 
meningitidis
Small, Pleomorphic Gram 
Negative Coccobacilli
H. influenzae
Meningitis – Common Viral Causes
•Non-arthropod
–Enterovirus: Echovirus, Coxsackie A 
& B, Enterovirus 70 & 71, Poliovirus
–HSV-2
•Arthropod
–Togavirus: Eastern equine 
encephalitis, Western equine 
encephalitis, Venezuelan equine 
encephalitis
–Flavivirus: St. Louis         encephalitis, 
West Nile virus
–Bunyavirus: California encephalitis
Meningitis – Less Common 
Viral Causes
•Uncommon
–Arenavirus: Lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis 
–Paramyxovirus: Mumps
–Retrovirus: HIV-1
•Rare
–Herpesvirus: HSV-1, Epstein-Barr, 
Cytomegalovirus, Varicella-zoster, 
Human herpesvirus type 6
–Adenovirus
–Coltivirus: Colorado tick fever
–Bunyavirus: Toscana virus
–Flavivirus: Zika meningoencephalitis
Viral Meningitis – Diagnosis 
and Treatment
•Diagnosis
–CSF examination : lymphocytic 
pleocytosis, normal glucose, 
mildly elevated protein
–PCR: better sensitivity and 
specificity than culture for 
enterovirus, HSV-2 and 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis
–Antibody detection : HSV-2, 
mumps, lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis
•Treatment: supportive, course 
usually benign; IV acyclovir for 
HSV-2Meningitis - TB
•If untreated, fatal in 4-8 weeks
•Clinically : fever, night 
sweats, sixth cranial nerve 
palsy, stroke due to arteritis, 
CXR abnormalities
•Suspect  in patients with 
history of TB, HIV, 
immunocompromised 
(especially drugs that block 
TNF-alpha)
•Treat with 4 drug regimen: 
isoniazid, rifampin, 
pyrazinamide and either a 
fluoroquinolone or 
aminoglycoside

enhancement of

•Cryptococcus neoformans  – 
immunosuppressed patients
•Histoplasma capsulatum – 
Endemic regions
•Mucormycosis – diabetes 
mellitus
•Aspergillosis – think of this if 
patient has had cerebral 
infarctMeningitis - Protozoal

spinal/epidural anesthesia)
–VasculitisEncephalitis
•Diffuse or focal inflammation 
of the brain
•Cause not identified in over 
½ of patients

simplex
–Seasonal: West Nile virus, 
Eastern Equine, Western 
Equine, enterovirusesEncephalitis: Clinical

–sore throat
–Progression to altered 
mental statusEncephalitis: Diagnosis and 
Treatment
•Imaging
•Spinal fluid analysis
–Serology
–PCR
•Treatment: supportive care, acyclovir 
if herpes simplex, target other 
etiologic agents as appropriate
Prion Diseases
•An infectious protein 
conformation that contains 
no specific nucleic acid
•Human form: Creutzfeld-
Jakob disease (CJD)
–Most forms sporadic, rest 
are genetic
–Transmitted by dietary 
exposure, cadaveric 
extracts, surgical 
instrumentsCJD
•Clinically: 
–psychiatric disturbance, 
cognitive dysfunction, motor 
signs, somatic sensory 
disturbances, myoclonus
–Develops over weeks
•Diagnosis: Elevated CSF 
proteins 14-3-3 or tau; brain 
biopsy is definitive
•Treatment: noneReferences
