JAMA. 2021;325(8):765-779. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.26858Chethana Gallage Dona, OMS-IIPathophysiology of Multiple Sclerosis 
●Autoimmune-mediated, neurodegenerative disease of CNS
●Inflammatory demyelination with axonal transection
●Irreversible neurological damage
●Gray matter and cortical lesions 
●Acute inflammatory phase —> chronic state 
●Chronic state 
○Remyelination
○Inflammation resolution w/o repair 
○Regeneration and demyelination co-exist 
●Both T cells and B cells involved 
○Ocrelizumab helps - suggestive of B cell involvement 
Factors in development of MS
Genetic Factors Environmental Factors 
MHC HLA-DRB1 locus Low Vitamin D levels (<100 nmol/L) or <40 ng/mL 
Ambient UV radiation 
EBV infection
Tobacco smokingWhat parts of the CNS does MS affect? 
●CNS 
○Brain 
○Spinal cord
○Optic nerve 
●Demyelination 
○Axonal transection Epidemiology & demographics 
●Young adults (onset 20-30 yrs) 
●More prevalent in higher latitudes 
○Increased sun exposure and Vit D levels - low MS prevalence 
●Family history 
○HLA-DR1 *15:01 allele
●Childhood obesity, cigarette smoking, EBV associated with increased risk MS Clinical subtypes 
●Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)
○Clinical relapses with near or complete recovery 
○Overtime, incomplete recovery -> disability 
○Neurologic decline overtime leads to secondary progressive MS
○Inflammation
●Primary-progressive MS (PPMS)
○Small population, progression from onset 
○Less inflammation, more neurodegeneration  
●Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS)
○In untreated MS, second clinical attack occurs typically within first 2 years
○Progress to SPMS (~15 years from onset) 
○InflammationClinical Presentation
●Unilateral optic neuritis 
○blurred vision w/ pain 
●Partial myelitis
○Extremity & torso impaired sensation, weakness, 
ataxia
●Focal sensory disturbance 
○Limb paresthesias, abdominal or chest banding 
●Brainstem syndromes 
○Intranuclear ophthalmoplegia, vertigo, hearing 
loss, facial sensory disturbance 
●Objective findings 
○Afferent pupillary defect, impaired sensation, 
motor weakness, ataxia, impaired gait, 
hyperreflexia 
●Relapse 
○Single clinical episode w/ Sx. for 24 hours, w/ or 
w/o recovery, in the absence of fever or infection
Diagnostic Criteria 
●Clinical findings 
○Dissemination of CNS lesions in space and 
time. 
●Imaging 
○MRI with gadolinium contrast of brain, orbits, 
spinal cord
●Lab data 
●Lumbar puncture
○CSF - CNS specific oligoclonal bands 
●McDonald Criteria (2017)
●Exclude alternative diagnosis  
○Sarcoidosis, Fabry’s disease, syphilis, toxic 
disorders, B12 deficiency, glioblastoma, 
cerebral infarction.  
MS lesions on MRI imaging studies 
●Brain atrophy
●Enlargement of ventricles 
& sulci 
●White matter lesions 
●Gray matter & cortical 
lesions (usually on 
autopsy)
Overall treatment & Management of MS 
●Disease modifying therapies
●Symptomatic treatment 
●Lifestyle modifications 
●Psychological support 
●Physical rehabilitation 
●Serial monitoring of neurologic exams 
●CNS MRI Disease modifying therapies (DMTs)
●Decrease relapse frequence and short-term disability 
●Original treatment modalities 
○Immunosuppressants - Azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, 
corticosteroids 
○Mitoxantrone - type II topoisomerase inhibitor - caused CHF 
●Current DMTs
○Monoclonal Abs 
○S1P receptor modulators
○Cladribine 
○Ocrelizumab
○Natalizumab
○Alemtuzumab
○IFN beta -1b DMT MOA
S1P receptor 
modulators Bind and internalize S1P receptors, sequester lymphocytes in lymph nodes. 
Cladribine  purine analogue, disrupts DNA synthesis and repair by incorporating into DNA and inhibiting key 
enzymes, leading to DNA strand breaks and cell death.
Ocrelizumab CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets specific B cells, reducing inflammation and cell damage 
(complement dependent and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity) 
Reduce B cell mediated inflammation that may lead to neurodegeneration. 
Natalizumab mAb that binds to a4 integrin on lymphocyte surface, prevent entry to CNS. 
Alemtuzumab mAb that binds to CD52 Ag on lymphocytes, leading to lymphocyte depletion 
●DMTs diminish neuroinflammation, some slow-down brain atrophy, treats mostly RRMS and SPMS
●Ocrelizumab - Only DMT approved for PPMS
