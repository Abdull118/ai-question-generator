Neuromuscular MedicineObjectives 
•Discuss neuromuscular junction disorders 
•Distinguish Pre-synaptic (Lambert Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome and Botulism) and 
Post-synaptic (Myasthenia Gravis) 
neuromuscular junction disorders 
•Discuss the clinical presentation, etiology, 
work up and treatment
•Review pathophysiology 
•Discuss myasthenic crisis and cholinergic 
crisis Neuromuscular Junction 
Disorders
•Pre-synaptic
–Lambert Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome
–Botulism
•Post-synaptic
–Myasthenia GravisLambert –Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome
•Antibodies to voltage 
gated calcium channels 
on presynaptic 
membrane
•Reduction of quanta 
release of acetylcholine
•Associations
–Small cell lung cancersLambert –Eaton myasthenic 
syndrome
Presentation
•Difficulty rising from chair, 
climbing stairs
•Ptosis, diplopia, 
dysarthria, and dysphagia
•Weakness may improve 
after few contractions
•Tendon reflexes are 
diminished
•Fasciculations absentInvestigations
•Anti – voltage gated 
calcium channel 
antibodies
–90 % of patients
–Specific
•EMGMYASTHENIA 
GRAVIS -•23 y/o  Man with 
fluctuating ptosis, diplopia, 
dysarthria, and walking 
difficulty without sensory 
symptoms.
Repetitive nerve 
stimulation: Decrement  PtosisNeuromuscular junction
Myasthenia gravis
•Any age
•Autoimmune against ACh 
receptors of postsynaptic 
neuromuscular junction  
fatigue and weakness
•Associated with thymoma 
•Associated with  
autoimmune disorders (e.g. 
thyroiditis, rheumatoid 
arthritis etc.)Myasthenia gravis
•Weakness, exacerbated by 
exertion
•No atrophy, No reflex 
abnormality, No sensory loss
•Clinical forms:
•Ocular form - ptosis, double vision
•Bulbar form - dysphagia, 
dysarthria, weakness of chewing
•Generalized form - weakness of 
limbs, with proximal emphasisClinical Features
•Weakness 
demonstrated 
by sustained 
activity, 
blinking, 
upward gaze
Clinical FeaturesClinical Features•Anti-acetylcholine receptor 
antibodies 80-90%
•Anti-muscle specific kinase 
(anti-MUSK)
•Tensilon (Edrophonium) test  
•Ice pack test:
•Single-fiber 
electromyography (SFEMG)Imaging: 
•Chest x-ray 
•Chest CT scan 
with contrast  Treatment
•Pyridostigmine/Neostigmine
•Thymectomy when progresses
•Over 60-70, use 
immunosuppressives
•Prednisone (steroids) for few 
weeks
•Azathioprine/6 MP
•Cyclosporine
•TacrolimusMyasthenic crisis 
•Rapid and severe deterioration 
of myasthenia.
•Severe generalized muscle 
weakness involving bulbar & 
respiratory muscles.
•Respiratory infections, use of 
contraindicated drugs are 
common precipitiating factors .
•Management: ICU
–Intubation & mechanical 
ventilation
–*Plasma exchange or IV 
immunoglobulin
–Treat infectionIVIG or 
plasmapheresisCholinergic crisis 
•Results from an excess of 
cholinesterase inhibitors 
•Clinically indistinguishable  from 
weakness due to MG 
•CF: Miosis and the SLUDGE 
syndrome 
–Salivation, lacrimation, urinary 
incontinence, diarrhea, GI upset 
and hypermotility, emesis.
•Bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, 
respiratory failure, & diaphoresis. 
•Tensilon worsens weakness
•Treatment: Anticholinergic & 
Beta-agonist bronchodilatorsBotulism
•Presynaptic part of the NMJ
•Prevents release of acetylcholine
•Food borne
–Infants at particular risk 
•Features
–Weakness, may be profound
–Autonomic system 
dysfunction
–Pupillary involvement
•Dx:  
–Nerve conduction studies
–Stool culture
•Rx:  Antitoxin, supportive
