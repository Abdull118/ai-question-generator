edition, chapter 391 (section on 
ALS), chapter 392Objectives
•Recognize the etiology, clinical presentation, 
evaluation/diagnosis and treatment/management 
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular 
atrophy
•Differentiate mononeuropathy, mononeuritis 
multiplex & polyneuropathy
•Recognize medications causing neuropathy
•Identify the clinical presentation, evaluation & 
treatment of Gullian-Barre Syndrome, Diabetic 
neuropathy, nutritional, toxic & vasculitic 
polyneuropathy, HIV neuropathies and those 
associated with Charcot Marie Tooth. 
•Recognize the etiologies and presentation of Bell’s 
palsy and how to distinguish a peripheral facial 
nerve lesion from a central lesion.Motor Neuron Disease
•Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) 
•Progressive muscular atrophy 
•Progressive bulbar palsy
•Primary lateral sclerosis
•Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS)
•A degenerative motor neuron disease
•Loss of motor neurons in the cortex, 
brainstem and spinal cord
•Clinical hallmark of ALS is a combination 
of UMN and LMN signs/symptoms
•UMN: weakness, hyperreflexia, spasticity
•Degeneration of upper motor neurons in frontal 
lobe (Brodman's area 4) and lateral 
corticospinal tract 
•LMN: weakness, atrophy/amyotrophy, 
fasciculations
•Degeneration of lower motor neurons in 
brainstem and spinal cord
•No sensory lossClinical Presentation-Clinical 
Course
•Relentlessly progressive and linear course
•Symptoms initially spread within the segment of onset 
and then to other regions 
•Most common presentation:
•asymmetric limb weakness (80%), bulbar onset (usually 
dysarthria or dysphagia) (20%)
•Much variation in clinical presentation:  site/segment 
(cranial, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral), onset, pattern 
7 spread of disease, degree of UMN/LMN dysfunction
• limb, bulbar, axial, and respiratory function.
•Cognitive impairment (fronto-temporal neurons) can 
precede or follow UMN/LMN involvement (10-15% will 
develop Fronto-temporal dementia)
•Ultimately progresses to neuromuscular respiratory failure 
and/or dysphagia, which prove fatalEpidemiology/Demographic 
Data
•Sporadic (90%) & familial forms (10%)
•Incidence increases w/decade of age > 40, 
peaks mid 70’s
•Risk factors:
•Age
•Family Hx
•Cigarette smoking ?
•Rates highest in Caucasians (USA)
•Etiologies continue to be studied
•Likely multifactorial
•Median survival 3-5 yearsDiagnosis of ALS 
•H & P suggestive 
•UMN & LMN Si/Sx, disease progression, & other 
causes ruled out)
•Electrodiagnostic studies
•EMG 
•Demonstrate signs of chronic denervation & 
reinnervation
•Gold Coast Criteria (2019)
•Progressive UMN/LMN symptoms and signs in 
one limb or body segment, OR
•Progressive lower motor neuron symptoms and 
signs in at least two body segments, AND
•Absence of electrophysiologic, neuroimaging, and 
pathologic evidence of other disease processes 
that might explain the signs of lower and/or 
upper motor neuron degenerationTreatment-Management 
of ALS
•Riluzole : only drug shown to impact 
survival by slowing progression
•Glutamate induced excitotoxicity
•MOA unclear
•Edavarone : free radical scavenger may 
reduce oxidative stress
•Evidence of benefit most in early ALS
•Experimental treatments:
•gene silencing therapy
•heat shock proteins
•skeletal muscle activators
•tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etc.Treatment-Management of 
ALS
•Respiratory symptoms
•Counseling
•Serial PFTs
•NIPPV (respiratory compromise)
•Mechanical ventilation
•Immunizations
•Gastrostomy tube (dysphagia)
•Other symptoms managed according to 
clinical experience, few RCTs conductedSpinal Muscular Atrophy 
(SMA)
•Most common form of inherited motor neuron 
disease 
•AR, SMN1 gene deletions/mutations
•Age of onset 
•Infancy: Werdnig Hoffman disease (SMA type 1)
•Adolescence: Kugelberg Welander disease (SMA type 3)
•Late onset (SMA type 4): mildest
•Diffuse symmetric proximal muscle weakness LE > 
UE, absent/reduced DTR’s
•Dx via molecular genetic testing (homozygous 
deletions in SMN1)
•Treatment is mainly supportive care, but disease 
modifying therapy is available

infection or other event cross-reacts with 
similar epitopes on peripheral nerves. 
Myelinated nerves are affected.GBS Pathophysiology
•Pathology: demyelination, axonal loss
•Demyelination: focal inflammatory 
response against Schwann cells,  peripheral 
myelin
•AIDP, Miller-Fischer syndrome
•Degrades blood-brain barrier
•Plasma proteins transudate into CSF
•Activated T-cell infiltration of small 
vessels   macrophage  mediated 
demyelination
•Axonal loss: immune reaction to epitopes 
on axonal membrane
•AMAN, AMSAN
•More frequent in Asia
•Humoral immune response causes axonal 
injury
•Infection with  c. jejuni most common 
antecedent infection/trigger
•H. influenzae, m. pneumoniae,  CMVHeterogeneous syndromes with 
variant forms

•CSF fluid analysis for all patients
•Elevated CSF protein with normal wbc count (albuminocytologic 
dissociation)
•Electrodiagnostic studies in atypical forms
•EMG, NCS
•Differentiate demyelinating vs axonal pathology
•Lab testing to rule out other causes of acute weakness
•CBC, CMP, ESR, serum glucose, glycosylated Hgb
•Autoantibody testing: 
•antiganglioside antibody (AMAN, AMSAN)
•Anti-GQ1b antibody (MFS) – oculomotor nerve myelin
•MRI, ultrasound can be used to rule out other causesGBS Treatment

widely in severity
Bell’s Palsy
•Aka Idiopathic facial nerve palsy
•Most common cause peripheral 
facial paralysis
•HSV activation proposed etiology
•VZV, CMV, EBV, rubella, mumps, 
coxsackievirus, influenza B
•Exact causes remain under study
•3X risk in pregnancy
•3rd trimester, 1st postpartum week
•Inflammation  demyelination  
palsy
Bell’s Palsy
•Sudden onset unilateral facial paralysis
•Eyebrow sagging, inability to close eye, 
loss of nasolabial fold, drooping at corner 
of mouth
•Psychological distress
•Diagnostic criteria
•Diffuse facial nerve involvement with 
paralysis of facial muscles, with or w/o loss 
of taste anterior 2/3 tongue or altered 
secretion of lacrimal, salivary glands
•Onset is acute (1-2 days), progressive, Sx 
peak w/in 3 weeks from onset , recovery of 
some function w/in 6 months 
•Some may have prodrome, ear pain, dysacusis
Bell’s Palsy
•Typically, a “clinical diagnosis”
•Labs/Imaging to rule out other 
causes of facial paralysis, or if 
presentation atypical
•Lyme serology, RPR, HIV, ESR, serum 
glucose, CSF analysis
•MRI: ID surgical causes
•Electrodiagnostic studies: prognosis
•Parotid gland biopsyPeripheral vs. Central lesion
•Sparing of forehead muscles on 
affected side  UMN lesion (central)
•Bilateral innervation
•LMN lesion  ipsilateral facial 
nerve, no forehead sparing
•However, a central brainstem lesion 
that involves the facial nerve nucleus in 
pons may present this way
Bell’s Palsy
•Management
•Oral glucocorticoids w/in 3 days of onset
•In severe cases, some have attempted anti-viral 
medications
•Supportive care
•Eye care to prevent corneal injury
•Protect during sleep
•Artificial tears, ointment
•In severe cases, incomplete recovery:
•Botulinum toxin
•Surgical decompression
•Prognosis generally favorable
•80-85% full recovery w/in 6 monthsThank you!Works Consulted
