(PLMS)Terminology
Disorder Presentation Characteristic lesion Things to remember
Athetosis •Slow, writhing movements
•Especially seen in fingers•Basal ganglia
•e.g. Huntington’s•Writhing, snake-like 
movement
Chorea •Sudden jerky, purposeless movements •Basal ganglia
•e.g., Huntington’s•Chorea= dancing
Dystonia •Sustained involuntary muscle contractions •Writer’s cramp
•Blepharospasm
Essential 
tremor•High frequency tremor with sustained posture
•Worse with movement or when anxious•Often familial
•ETOH ↓ tremor
•Rx : βblockers, primidone
Hemiballismus •Sudden, wild flailing of 1 arm with or without 
ipsilateral leg•Contralateral subthalamic 
nucleus
•e.g. lacunar stroke•“Half of body ballistic”
•Contralateral lesion
Intention 
tremors•Slow, zigzag motion when pointing/extending 
toward an object/target•Cerebellar dysfunction
Myoclonus •Sudden, brief, uncontrolled muscle contraction •Jerk, hiccups
•Think metabolic disorders
Resting Tremor •Uncontrolled movement of distal 
appendages(hands>feet)
•Tremor alleviated by intentional movement•Parkinson’s disease •Occurs at rest
•“Pill rolling” tremor seen in 
Parkinson’s
Chart adapted from First Aid for the USLME Step1,25e, 2015Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
•Progressive neurodegenerative disease
•Tremor: “pill rolling”, rest tremor
•Rigidity: resistance to passive movement
•“cogwheel rigidity”, “lead pipe rigidity”
•Bradykinesia: major cause of disability
•Levodopa responsive
•Later Signs/Symptoms
•Postural instability: impairment of centrally 
mediated postural reflexes
•Levodopa unresponsive
•Gait disorder
•Non-motor 
•Depression, cognitive dysfunction, sexual 
dysfunction
PD Pathophysiology
•Dopamine depletion in substantia nigra and 
nigrostriatal pathway to caudate & putamen 
thalamic inhibition, reduced excitatory input to 
motor cortex
•Depigmentation, neuronal loss, gliosis
•Substantia nigra pars compacta & pontine locus ceruleus
•Lewy bodies
•Round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions in nuclei of 
neurons
•Hallmark pathologic finding of PD
•Mechanism of neurodegeneration incompletely 
understood
•Most are sporadic, but rare hereditary forms exist•Rare prior to age 40 
•Incidence increases substantially 
after age 60
•Possible male predisposition
•Consistent evidence shows 
increasing age & family history 
are risk factors, and that smoking 
is protective Parkinson Disease:
Diagnosis
•Clinical history & neuro exam
•Bradykinesia + tremor or rigidity
•Response to dopaminergic tx
•Supportive features:
•Dose-response to dopaminergics, levo-dopa 
induced dyskinesia, rest tremor of a limb, 
olfactory loss or cardiac sympathetic 
denervation on scintigraphy
•No physiologic, radiologic or blood 
tests for Dx
•“Gold standard”: neuropathologic 
examination (autopsy)Parkinson Disease:
Red Flags
•If observed in first 5 yrs, indicate Dx of 
PD is incorrect/needs further 
investigation:
•Rapid progression of gait impairment
•Absence of progression of motor Sx
•Early bulbar dysfunction
•Severe autonomic failure
•Absence of common non-motor Sx
•Bilateral symmetric motor SxPD Initial Management  
•Age, degree of impairment of functioning & quality 
of life
•May not require medication if Sx mild, not interfering
•Levodopa: most potent
•Highest risk of dopaminergic motor complications
•MAO B inhibitors: least potent
•Selegiline, safinamide, rasagiline
•Amantadine: least potent
•Dopamine agonists: intermediate potency
•Bromocriptine, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine
•Anticholinergics
•Tremor
•Beware of use in geriatric populations Parkinsonism in other 
disorders
•Alzheimer’s disease
•Huntington disease
•Frontotemporal dementia
•Spinocerebellar ataxiasSecondary Parkinsonism
•Medications: most common 2° cause
•Antipsychotics and antiemetics (neuroleptics) most frequent
•Usually, reversible
•Toxins
•CO, cyanide, organic solvents
•Head trauma
•Structural brain lesions
•Metabolic disorders
•Wilson dz, hypoparathyroidism and 
pseudohypoparathyroidism, liver failure, extrapontine 
myelinosis
•Infections
•HIV/AIDS, neurosyphilis, prion disease, PML, toxoplasmosis, 
encephalitis lethargica
•Cerebrovascular diseaseHuntington Disease (HD)
•Inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by:
•Choreiform movements
•Psychiatric pathology
•Depression, dysphoria, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, 
hallucinations
•Dementia
•Executive dysfunction
•AD inheritance pattern
•50% chance of inheritance
•Most prevalent in those w/European ancestry
•Insidious onset
•Motor function deteriorates w/progression to 
parkinsonian, akinetic-rigid state
•Onset can occur in childhood up to the 8th decade
•Most middle aged
•Dx < age 20 = juvenile formHD Pathophysiology
•Trinucleotide repeat expansion
•CAG
•Number of repeats correlates with disease 
severity
•Diffuse marked atrophy of the 
neostriatum 
•caudate > putamen
•Aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein a 
hallmark of HDHD Diagnosis
•Diagnosis based on:
•Typical clinical features
•Family history
•Genetic testing
•Trinucleotide repeat expansion in huntingtin 
(HTT) gene
•Axial MRI
•Lateral ventricles: caudate atrophy in late 
stagesHD Management
•Supportive: manage Sx, improve quality of life
•Multidisciplinary care team
•Chorea
•Interferes w/functioning
•Tx can exacerbate parkinsonism, cognition, mood
•Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2)
•Non-depressed patients
•2nd generation antipsychotics
•w/depression, other comorbidities
•Risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole
•Psychosis
•Quetiapine
•Mood d/o
•SSRI’s, anxiolyticsWilson’s Disease
(Hepatolenticular degeneration)  
•Inherited disorder of copper metabolism
•AR inheritance
•Intracellular copper transporter  ATB7B
•Impaired biliary copper excretion
•Copper accumulates in organs
•Liver, brain, cornea
•Hepatic, neurologic & psychiatric 
manifestations
•Diagnosis usually age 5-35
•Fatal if untreated; good prognosis with 
treatment adherenceWilson's Disease 
Clinical Presentation
•Hepatic
•Acute liver failure, acute or chronic 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, steatosis, 
•Neurologic
•Dysarthria, movement disorders, etc.
•Psychiatric
•Depression, personality change, 
incongruous behavior, irritability
•Kaiser-Fleischer rings
•Coombs negative hemolytic anemiaWilson's Disease
Diagnosis
•Liver biochemical testing
•CBC
•Serum ceruloplasmin & copper levels
•90% low serum ceruloplasmin levels
•Copper decreased in proportion to 
ceruloplasmin levels
•Ocular slit-lamp exam
•24-hour urinary copper excretion
•Elevated urinary copper
•Equivocal/Atypical cases
•Liver biopsy
•Genetic testingWilson's Disease
Management
•Treatment lifelong; d/c Tx can cause 
acute liver failure
•2 phases
•Remove accumulated tissue copper
•Chelating agents
•D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc
•Monitor copper levels
•6 months – 5 years of Tx
•Prevent re-accumulation of copper 
(maintenance)
•Zinc, lower doses of chelator
•Acute liver failure
•Plasmapheresis, plasma exchange therapy, 
hemofiltration, dialysis
•Transplantation
•Diet: avoid foods high in copperReferences
