doi:10.1001/jama.2016.18625Objectives
•Define and differentiate seizure and 
epilepsy, provoked and unprovoked 
seizures
•Review classification and types of 
seizure and epilepsy
•Discuss differential diagnosis of seizure 
and components of taking a seizure 
history
•Discuss characteristics and clinical 
presentation of each
•Discuss diagnostic evaluation and 
treatmentSeizure Epidemiology
•Seizures are common in general 
pop.
•1 in 10 people will have one
•Most are provoked and not 
epilepsy
•Incidence > in men, bimodal age 
distribution
•Neonatal (to age 1 yr)
•Elderly (after 75 yrs)Epilepsy Epidemiology
•1 in 26 people will develop 
epilepsy at some point in life
•Peak incidence in children < 5 yo 
and elderly > 75 yo
•Higher incidence and prevalence 
in developing countriesDefinitions
•Seizure:  transient focal or generalized 
signs or symptoms due to abnormal 
excessive or synchronous neuronal 
activity in the brain
•Focal:  originates in one cerebral 
hemisphere, signs & symptoms 
correspond to specific region of brain 
affected
•Generalized :  rapidly affect extensive 
neuronal networks on both hemispheres, 
signs & symptoms consistent with 
involvement of both hemispheres•Seizure ≠ Epilepsy
•Epilepsies:  group of conditions where 
underlying neurologic disorder results 
in chronic, recurrent unprovoked 
seizures
•Differentiate from “provoked” or 
“acute symptomatic” seizures
•Acute brain insult causes one or more 
seizures but not chronic  seizure 
tendency
•Treat provoking factor
•No chronic AEDs (antiepileptic drugs) 
neededEpilepsy:  Diagnostic Criteria
Risk factors
Risk factors
•Epilepsy:
•Pediatric
•Febrile seizure
•Head trauma
•Brain infections
•Intellectual disability
•Cerebral palsy
•ADHD
•Adult
•Head trauma
•Brain infection
•Alzheimer disease
•Migraine HA
•HypertensionDifferential Diagnosis
Key H&P points in suspected seizure
•Detailed description of seizure, from patient 
and witnesses
•Circumstances prior to sz, ictal behaviors, 
postictal state
•Prior seizures or seizure-like activity?
•Medication history, PMHx (risk factors), FHx of 
seizure
•Neurologic exam for focal abnormalities 
(weakness, hyperreflexia, babinski)
•Physical exam (tongue bite/laceration)
•Lab studies to r/o toxic-metabolic, infectious 
causes, ECG, EEG, neuroimaging, lumbar 
puncture
•Serum ProlactinFocal SeizuresFocal Seizure
•Formerly termed “Partial seizure”
•Originate in networks limited to one 
hemisphere
•Categorized by awareness
•Focal seizures w/impaired awareness most 
common seizure in adult epilepsy
•Further categorized by motor or non-motor 
symptomsClinical Manifestations:  Focal Seizures
•Signs and symptoms correspond to 
the functions of the area of cerebral 
hemisphere affected
•Focal seizures subclassified based on 
their clinical expression:
•Somatosensory, motor, auditory, 
olfactory, gustatory, vertiginous, visual, 
limbic, dyscognitiveAura
•Sensory, autonomic or psychic 
symptoms occurring before 
observable seizure
•Aura is its own focal seizure
•Only occur in focal seizures
•Taking patient history of aura 
details can be essential to 
making the diagnosisClinical Manifestations:  Focal Seizures
•Focal Motor :
•Local tonic (stiffening), clonic (jerking), atonic 
(loss of muscle tone) or automatisms (repeated 
or automatic movements)
•Jacksonian March:  abnormal movements in one 
body part gradually spread to adjacent areas on 
same side of the body
•Focal to Bilateral Tonic Clonic:  if focal seizure 
spreads to both sides of body (thus bilateral brain 
involvement)Clinical Manifestations:  Focal Seizures
•Non-motor Seizures:
•Focal Sensory:  
•can manifest in any sensory modality (e.g., pins & 
needles, metallic taste or smell, flashing lights, 
buzzing sound)
•Focal Cognitive or Emotional
•Experiential or “psychic” manifestations (e.g., 
altered language function, perception, memory, 
emotions, déjà vu or jamais vu, etc.)
•Focal Autonomic:  evoke changes in autonomic 
activity (e.g., altered heart rate) or visceral 
sensations (e.g., in abdomen or chest)Clinical Manifestations:  Focal Seizures
•Postictal period
•Weakness, confusion, exhaustion, etc.
•Todd paralysis
•Asking  a patient about the presence 
of a postictal period is essential to 
proper diagnosis and classificationGeneralized SeizuresGeneralized Seizure
•Originate at some point within 
brain and rapidly engage 
bilaterally distributed networks, 
which can be cortical or 
subcortical structures
•Does not need to involve entire 
cortex and may be asymmetric
•Can also arise from a focal 
lesionGeneralized Tonic-Clonic Seizures
•Associated with loss of consciousness 
and post-ictal confusion and lethargy
•“Grand mal ”, “convulsive” seizures
•Usually last 30 seconds, up to 2 
minutes
•NO AURA
•Initial TONIC PHASE
•Stiffening and fall
•Often associated with “ictal cry”
•Air forced through contracted vocal cords
•Subsequent CLONIC PHASE
•Rhythmic extremity jerking, gradually 
slows then stops
Typical Absence Seizures
•Brief staring spells (“ petit mal ”) with 
impairment of awareness
•3-20 seconds
•SUDDEN onset & sudden resolution
•NO postictal period
•COMPLETE reduction in responsiveness
•May be accompanied by “automatisms”
•Often provoked by hyperventilation
•Can be used to test clinically
•Onset typically between ages 4-14, resolves 
by age 18
•Normal development & intelligenceMyoclonic Seizures
•Epileptic myoclonus
•Brief, shock-like jerk of a muscle or group of 
muscles
•Bilateral, synchronous, commonly affects 
neck, shoulders, upper arms, torso, upper legs
•Consciousness not impaired
•Several in rhythmic succession termed 
“CLONIC SEIZURE ”; awareness may be altered)
•Differentiate from benign, nonepileptic 
myoclonus (e.g., occurs while falling asleep 
in healthy persons, not a seizure)
•Occur in a variety of epilepsy syndromesTonic Seizures
•Bilateral, symmetric, tonic muscle 
contraction of extremities 
•tonic flexion of waist and neck, abduction, 
flexion or extension of upper and lower 
extremities
•Last 2-20 seconds
•Typically occur during sleep
•More common in people w/other 
neurologic diagnosesAtonic Seizures
•Sudden loss of postural tone
•If severe can result in falls
•Milder forms cause head nods or jaw 
drops
•”Drop attack”
•Consciousness usually impaired
•Lasts seconds, rarely > 1 min.
•More common in people w/other 
neurologic diagnosesGeneralized Convulsive Status Epilepticus 
(GCSE)
•MEDICAL EMERGENCY
•>5 minutes of continuous seizure activity, or >1 
seizure without recovery in between
•Acute brain injury or infection, noncompliance 
w/seizure meds, withdrawal syndromes, 
metabolic disturbances
•Generalized convulsive, focal motor, myoclonic, 
tonic
•Clinical Diagnosis; Treatment initiated 
immediately to avoid severe outcomes
•“ABC’s”, hemodynamic and respiratory 
monitoring and support (intubation); IV 
benzodiazepines (lorazepam), long-acting AEDs 
(fosphenytoin)
•EEG afterward to r/o nonconvulsive statusNonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
(NCSE)
•Ongoing or intermittent seizure activity 
without convulsions, without recovery of 
consciousness between attacks, lasting >10 
min
•Various degrees of impairment of 
consciousness
•Diagnosis largely based on EEG 
confirmation
•Treatment varies based on etiologyChildhood SyndromesFebrile Seizure
•Seizure with febrile illness
•Typically age 6 mo-6 yrs
•Duration < 15 min
•Generalized tonic-clonic sz
•Occurs w/in 1st
 24 hrs of illness
•Diagnosis based on history, limited 
workup possibly
•Treat by decreasing temp, tx 
infection, reassurance
•Good prognosis Benign Neonatal Convulsion
•Short tonic, clonic or apneic
•Onset 2-5 days postpartum, infants 
without other neurologic issues
•Good prognosis, 15% will develop 
epilepsy laterBenign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal 
Spikes (BECTS)
•“Benign Rolandic Epilepsy”
•Most common focal epilepsy of 
childhood
•Presents around 8 yrs of age
•Focal motor or secondarily generalized 
seizures that occur mostly at night
•Tonic or clonic activity with parasthesias 
of lower face, drooling, dysarthria
•Dx with Hx and EEG
•Seizures remit around adolescence, 
normal neurologic developmentLennox-Gastaut Syndrome
•Intellectual disability, multiple types 
of seizure and diffuse, slow spikes & 
waves on EEG
•Poor prognosis for neuro-cognitive 
outcomes and seizure controlManagementOverview:  Diagnostic Workup
•Is this a true seizure? R/o others in DDx
•If so, provoked or unprovoked?
•For a new onset of seizure:
•Serum electrolytes (chemistry panel), 
indicators of infection, toxin screen (UDS)
•Neuroimaging:
•MRI
•CT can r/o obvious catastrophic causes 
•EEG Overview:  Treatment
•Main goals of treatment are:
•Seizure control
•Avoid treatment side effects
•Quality of life
•For an active seizure:
•ABC’s
•Vital signs
•Patient safety
•Benzodiazepine (IV lorazepam) to break 
seizure if continued activityPrinciples of Management
•Drug therapy is NOT usually indicated after a single 
seizure
•2/3 of patients do not warrant treatment
•Drug monotherapy:  individuals at risk of recurrent 
seizure
•Selection of AED depends on multiple patient factors
•Broad-spectrum:  lamotrigine, topiramate, valproate, etc.
•Narrow-spectrum:  carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
lacosamide
•Some will consider AED discontinuation if > 2yrs 
seizure-free
•AED may be enzyme-inducers
•Limit effects of other drugs (e.g., OCPs)
•Monitor for changes in mood, suicidality (black box 
warning)•Patient education at each office 
visit
•Folate for females of 
childbearing age
•Teratogenesis
•Driving restrictions (check state 
law)Works Consulted
