To all Touro COM – NY Students; 
This packet is a review of common orthopedic and sport s related topic s that are 
frequently encountered in clinical practice and are high yield topics for your board preparation. 
I have listed several references for you in the event that you want to read up on these topics in
greater detail. Man y of these topic s have been reviewed in other c lasses like anatomy, physical 
diagnosis, and OMM so you can also refer back t o the mater ial in those clas ses for review. 
Please p ay attention to specificall y mentioned anatomical landmarks or blood supply as these 
are frequentl y tested in multiple ways as they are crucial to th e patient’s clinical presentation.

P a g e  4 | 22 FRACTURES OF THE 5TH METATARSAL  
Mechanism of injury  Caused by forced inversion while foot is plantar flexed
Involves contraction of fibularis (peroneus)  brevis &
contracture of medial band of plantar fascia
Often misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain – Always palpate the
base of the fifth metatarsal in all ankle aprians, if tenderness
noted get FOOT & ANKLE xrays so you don’t miss this
fracture!!!
Classification  1.Avulsion fracture of tuberosity
2.Acute proximal diaphyseal fractures (aka “Jone’s” fractures)
3.Stress fractures of the proximal diaphysis
Clinical Systems -NMM Module  | Angela Cavanna, DO

Clinical Systems -NMM Module  | Angela Cavanna, DO  
P a g e  6 | 22 Lower Limb  Injuries : Knee  
PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN SYNDROME  
Other names 
for this 
condition  Jumper’s Knee (clinical)
Runner’s knee (clinical)
Chondromalacia patella
(pathological diagnosis)
Pathology  Softening, erosions, &
fragmentation of the articular
cartilage of the patella  (Only
seen on arthroscopy)
Etiology  Overload/overuse
Patellar  Malalignment resulting
in abnormal patellar tracking
(ex. Leg length discrepancies,
hamstring & hip flexor
tightness, weak vastus medialis
or hip musculature, excessive
foot eversion  (pronation ), etc.)
Clinical 
Presentation  •Pain poorly localized around ,
about or under the patella
•Pain worsens with squatting,
running prolonged sitting
•Crepitus may be noted with
flexion/extension of the knee
•Patellar grind  & apprehension*
testing often positive
Radiographs  usually not indicated
“Sunrise views”
MRI if symptoms persist or
suspicion of other knee
pathology
Treatment  Assess for biomechanical
abnormalities that can be
correcte d
Ice post activities
NSAIDs for acute flares
OMM
Physical Therapy
Orthotics
*Patellar grind test  (a.k.a. Clarke's Sign): The patellar grind test assesses the presence of abnormal patellar movement and accompanying degree of painful crepitation 
upon contraction of the quadriceps muscles. A positive test result includes painful crepitation at the patellofemoral joint.
The 
patellar apprehension test is used to evaluate for patellofemoral instability. To perform this test, have the patient lie supine & relax their quadriceps muscle. With 
the knee slightly flexed, attempt to slide the patella laterally or medially with your thumb. The test is positive if the patient experiences a sensation that their knee is 
going to give out or is unstable. Laxity alone is not sufficient for a positive test.Clinical Systems -NMM Module  | Angela Cavanna, DO  
P a g e  7 | 22 “UNHAPPY” OR “TERRIBLE” TRIAD  
Mechanism 
of injury  Rotation of the hips and torso
with a planted foot

ambulation & instability with
special tests of the knee.
(Lachman, Anterior Drawer,
etc.)
Treatment  Treatment is usually surgical
PREPATELLAR BURSITIS  (AKA “HOUSEMAIDS” KNEE)  
Mechanism 
of injury  Recurrent trauma
Seen in individuals who frequently kneel
Can be related to an infection, gout, or
another systemic form of arthritis
Pathology  Inflammation of the bursa
Clinical  Swelling of the prepatellar bursa
May be painful if due to acute trauma,
infection, or gout; painless if chronic in
nature
Treatment  Depends on underlying etiology
Needs aspiration if infection or crystal
disease suspected
Clinical Systems -NMM Module  | Angela Cavanna, DO  
P a g e  8 | 22 TIBIAL TUBEROSITY AVULSION (AKA OSGOOD SCHLATTER’S DISEASE)  
Mechanism 
of Injury  Traction apophysitis  of the proximal tibial
tuberosity
Overuse injury due to repetitive contraction of
the quadriceps muscles in growing children that
places stress on the tibial tubercle and chronic
avulsion of the secondary ossificat ion center of
the tibial tuber osity
Pathology  Osteoc hondritis of the tibial tuberosity
Clinical  Typically seen in  13 to 14 -year -old boy or
skeletally equivalent 11 to 12 -year -old girl who
has recently undergone a rapid growth spurt
Tenderness & soft tissue or bony p rominence of
the tibial tuberosity
Tight hamstrings a& quadriceps muscles
Erythema  & warmth of the tibial tuberosity
usually suggests acute inflammation but must rule
out an infection
Treatment  Conservative treatment is mainstay:  Rest, Ice,
Stretching
NSAIDs for pain
OMM
Physical Therapy
Braces /padding to protect tibial tuberosity
Surgery in rare cases that do not respond to
conservative treatment

forces applied to the
femoral head exceed the
strength of the capital
femoral physis
Clinical  Hip pain is a common
presenting feature  but,
approximately 15 percent
of patients present with
isolated thigh or knee pain
Slipping  of the epiphysis is
a slow & gradual process
but maybe associated
with a minor fall or
trauma.

history of several weeks
or months of hip or kn ee
pain &  an intermittent
limp

a birth defect in that area of
the spine or sudden injury
(acute trauma)
In adults, the most common
cause is abnormal wear on
the cartilage and bones,
such as arthritis
Treatment : 
Depends on severi ty of
symptoms
