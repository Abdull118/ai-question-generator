Harris, John H.; Pope, Thomas L.. Published December 31, 2014. Pages 13-20.e3. © 2015. FIGURE 2–2Type of 
FractureDefinition
Avulsion •when a fragment of bone is separated 
from the main mass.
Buckled or 
impacted 
fracture•ends are driven into each other; 
commonly seen in arm fractures in 
children.
Comminuted •the bone breaks into several pieces
Compression 
or Wedge•usually involves the bones in the back 
(vertebrae)
Greenstick •an incomplete fracture in which the bone 
is bent; occurs most often in childrenType of 
FractureDefinition
Linear •the break is parallel to the bone’s long axis.
Oblique •the break has a curved or sloped pattern
Pathologic •caused by a disease that weakens the 
bones
Spiral •one part of the bone has been twisted at 
the break point
Stress •a hairline crack
Transverse •the broken piece of bone is at a right angle 
to the bone’s axisPhases of Fracture HealingReactive Phase•Immediately 
after fracture
•Bleeding & 
hematoma 
formation at 
the fracture 
site
•Fibrous 
tissue/callus 
formation
Reparative Phase•Proximal periosteal 
cells become 
chondroblasts
•Distal periosteal cells 
become osteoblasts
•Cartilage and woven 
bone formation-
callus
•Callus replaced via 
endochondral 
ossification
Remodeling•Replacement 
of trabecular 
bone with 
compact bone
Healing Terminology
1.Union
•Healing of fracture in the expected 
amount of time, which varies according 
to age, species, bone involved, level of 
the fracture, and associated soft tissue 
injury
2.Delayed union
•Healing of fracture in a longer 
than expected amount of time
Healing Terminology
3.Nonunion
•Failure to heal without further 
intervention in the expected amount of 
time
•FDA: 9 months elapsed time with no 
healing progress for 3 months 
4.Malunion
•Healing with considerable deformity that 
may affect function
Treatment 
•Casting and bracing
•Plaster or fiberglass
•External fixation
•Pins or wires set into the bone through the skin both 
above and below the fracture. They are connected 
to ring/bar outside the skin and hold pins in place. 
After  healing, pins are removed.
•Internal fixation
•Surgery-rods or wires or screws inserted into bone 
fragments to keep them together.
•Other treatment options
•Bone grafts (allo vs. auto)
•Bone stimulators
•Artificial matrix
•Nutritional support

Clavicle
•First bone in the human skeleton to ossify
•Serves as the only bony connection between 
the arm and the trunk
•Fracture usually due to direct blow to shaft
•Group I consists of fractures of the middle 
third(69%), Group II of the distal third(28%), 
and Group III (2.8%) of the proximal third
•Generally depressed fracture
•May impact brachial plexus or neurovascular 
bundle
•Treated conservatively with figure of 8 splint
•Rarely requires surgery ©2017 UpToDate®
Clavicle Fracture
Acromioclavicular Joint Separation
•Usually occurs from direct trauma to the superior 
or lateral aspect of the shoulder with the arm 
adducted, such as falling onto the shoulder
•Diagnosis made by History, physical exam & 
radiographic findings
•Need to compare sides to determine if separation at 
AC joint exists.
•Several types based on severity of injury:
•I-III generally treated nonsurgically, but can be 
treated surgically electively for cosmetic reasons, 
although functional impairment may persist
•IV-VI with significant displacement of the distal end 
of the clavicle. Generally requires surgical 
correction.
Acromioclavicular injury Type I
Proximal Humerus Fractures
•Anatomic neck/head
•Usually due to fall onto outstretched hand or 
directly onto shoulder
•Commonly causes avascular necrosis: needs 
surgery
•Surgical neck
•Need for surgical fixation depends on angulation 
and displacement of fragment s
•Greater tuberosity: 
•Attachment for 3 of the rotator cuff muscles: 
supraspinatus, infraspinatus & teres minor
•Lesser tuberosity 
•Provides the attachment for the subscapularis muscle
•Marks the boundary between the proximal humerus & 
the midshaft.
1.Axillary artery
2.Posterior humeral 
circumflex artery
3.Anterior humeral 
circumflex artery
4.Lateral ascending branch of 
the anterior humeral 
circumflex artery
5.Greater tuberosity
6.Lesser tuberosity
7.Tendon insertion of the 
infraspinatus muscle
8.Tendon insertion of the 
teres minor muscleThe lateral ascending branch of the anterior circumflex 
humeral artery carries the most important blood supply 
of the humeral head and damage may lead to avascular 
necrosis.Humerus Fractures
•Shaft
•Concern for spiral groove fracture, radial 
nerve and/or profunda brachii artery 
injury
•Treatment:
•Depend on severity
•Surgical fixation for comminuted fractures & 
those with neurovascular complications
•Bracing for nondisplaced transverse 
fractures

Fractures
•Rare in adults but common in children
•Usually do to fall with outstretched hand (“FOOSH”)
•Both are usually treated surgically due to potential 
for neurovascular complications 
Radial Head/Neck Fracture
•Usually a “FOOSH” injury
•Pain & swelling along medial antecubital 
region and decreased ROM of the elbow
•Diagnosis based on clinical suspicion as often 
symptoms maybe mild
•Often difficult to see on X-ray
•Fat pad or “sail” sign
•May need CT scan or MRI
•Treatment
•Nondisplaced
•Conservative
•Complex
•Ortho referral
©2017 UpToDate®
©2017 UpToDate®Ulnar Fracture: “Nightstick”
•Blow against an upraised forearm to protect 
head
•Nonoperative treatment (casting/splinting) is 
the accepted approach for uncomplicated 
"nightstick" but if it involves the proximal third 
of the ulnar; is extremely angulated or it 
involves the radius as well, it may require 
surgery. 
•Caveat is that these patients need to be 
evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon 
•Complications: compartment syndrome, loss of 
pronation and supination
©2017 UpToDate®
Galeazzi Fracture
•A Galeazzi fracture is 
defined as a radial 
midshaft fracture 
associated with 
instability of the distal 
radioulnar joint (DRUJ)
•Treatment
•Surgery 
©2017 UpToDate®Monteggia Fracture 
•A Monteggia fracture is defined 
as a fracture of the proximal 
third of the ulnar shaft 
associated with dislocation of 
the radial head 
•Treatment:
•Surgery
•Complications:
•Entrapment of radial or median 
nerves
•Loss of ROM
©2017 UpToDate®
Distal Radius Fracture
•Most common fracture site in the upper 
extremity
• “FOOSH” injury
•May have associated scaphoid dislocation
•In elderly maybe first sign of osteoporosis
•Clinically:
•Pain & deformity at wrist
•"dinner-fork" deformity associated with Colles' fracture
•Exam however may just reveal tenderness to palpation 
over the distal radius
•Treatment:
•Can be closed reduced & casted

Mallet Finger “Baseball Finger”
•Injury to extensor tendon of the DIP 
•Due to ball or other object hitting the end of the 
finger & causing hyperflexion of the DIP, causing 
a tendon rupture & possibly an avulsion fracture 
of the proximal portion of the phalanx
•Clinically the patient cannot extend the distal 
phalanx
•Treatment is splinting but surgery maybe 
indicated if fracture segment large 
Jersey Finger
•Refers to an avulsion injury of FDP from insertion at base 
of distal phalanx 
•Ring finger involved in 75% of cases 
•FDP muscle belly in maximal contraction during forceful 
DIP extension
•Clinically:
•pain & tenderness over volar distal finger
•finger lies in  slight extension  relative to other fingers in resting 
position    
•no active flexion of DIP
•may be able to palpate flexor tendon retracted proximally along 
flexor sheath
•Treatment: Surgery

Hip Fractures
http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0201/afp20030201p537-f3.jpgFemoral Neck Fractures
•Femoral neck fractures are intracapsular.
•The tenuous blood supply to the femoral neck ↑ 
risk of complications, such as avascular necrosis
•Femoral neck fractures tend to occur in elderly 
patients who fall. 
•A fall directly onto the lateral hip
•A twisting mechanism in which the patient's foot is 
planted and the body rotates
•A sudden spontaneous completion of a fatigue (or 
insufficiency) fracture, which then causes a fall
•In younger individuals fractures generally occur as a 
result of major trauma
•Treatment pinning if nondisplaced, otherwise 
bipolar hemiarthroplasty

Slide from Marshall Kurtz, D.O . Intertrochanteric fractures 
•Extracapsular
•Lower risk for complications related to disrupted 
blood supply
•Higher risk for displacement 
•Common In the elderly population post fall 
•Rare in younger individuals (Think Major 
Trauma)
•Clinically:
•Pain, ecchymosis, thigh swelling & blood loss
•Injured leg may be shortened and externally rotated 
if the fracture is displaced
•Treatment: Surgery

sliding_compression_screw_devicesCompression Screw Fixation Femoral Shaft Fractures
•Longest, strongest, & heaviest tubular bone in 
the human body and one of the principal load 
bearing bones in the lower extremity
•Fractures of the femoral shaft often result from 
high energy forces such as motor vehicle 
collisions
•Complications can be life & limb threatening:
•Compartment syndrome
•Wound infection
•Fat embolism
•Associated internal organ injuries & adult respiratory 
distress syndrome
•Treatment: Surgery
©2017 UpToDate®Distal Femur Fractures
•Usually involve the femoral condyles
•Maybe associated with shaft fractures
•Depending on location may extend 
intraarticular at the knee 
•Require surgery to correct
http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/supracondylar_femoral_fractures
Patella Fractures
•Most fractures of the patella 
result from direct forces:
•Fall onto a flexed knee
•Knee striking the dashboard 
during an automobile accident
•In cases of high-energy blunt 
trauma (e.g. MVA), look for other 
injuries to the femur, hip, & pelvis 
•Treatment depends on severity
•Nondisplaced-conservative
•Displaced surgery
•Extensive rehab required post healing
Tibial Plateau Fractures
•Most commonly involve the lateral plateau & 
involve a direct blow to the area
•Medial tibial plateau fractures require a higher 
force such as landing on one's feet after falling 
from a height
•Diagnosis made on clinical findings & 
radiographic assessment. 
•Subtle injuries or those related to osteoporosis may 
not be readily apparent on x-ray and  MRI or CT 
required
•Emergent surgical consultation is required for 
fractures that cause vascular compromise or 
acute compartment syndrome.
•Surgical repair indicated for all depressed 
segments to restore joint

Fractures of the Tibia
•Tibia major weight bearing bone of lower leg
•Fracture usually due to torsional injury
•May be isolated to the tibia or involve the fibula 
as well
•Emergent surgical referral is required for all 
open fractures, fractures associated with 
neurovascular injury or suspected acute 
compartment syndrome, and fractures 
associated with dislocation of the knee or 
ankle.
•High risk for acute compartment syndrome 
(ACS), a potentially limb-threatening 
complication
Ankle Fractures
•Malleolar
•Lateral
•Medial
•Bimalleolar
•Trimalleolar
•Fracture-dislocation
•General Rule of thumb:
•Can treat conservatively with casting if minimally 
displaced & no joint instability, otherwise surgical 
fixation required.

Ottawa Ankle Rules
Ankle films: 
•Only obtain if there is  pain in malleolar zone & 
any of these findings: 
1.Bone tenderness at A
2.Bone tenderness at B
3.Inability to bear weight both 
immediately & in the ED
Foot films:
•Only obtain if there is any pain in midfoot zone & 
any of these findings: 
1.Bone tenderness at C
2.Bone tenderness at D
3.Inability to bear weight both 
immediately & in the EDAnkle Mortise View
•The mortise view enables 
assessment for fractures & 
spacing of the entire joint 
surface, including that 
between the fibula & talus
•The distance between the 
talus & either the fibula or 
tibia should be equal 
throughout the joint.
©2017 UpToDate®Lateral Malleolus
•No single, widely accepted definition of the 
anatomic margins of the lateral malleolus
•Most used definition it that it refers to the 
distal part of the fibula that articulates with 
the talus & distal tibia
•Lateral malleolar fractures lie between the 
distal tip of the fibula (inferior yellow line) 
and the most proximal portion of the fibula 
that lies directly adjacent to the tibia in the 
tibial groove (superior yellow line)

•Involvement of the Medial, 
Lateral AND Posterior Malleolus 
(posterior tibia-talus junction)
•Very Unstable
•Often Associated with 
dislocation
•Surgical Fixation required to 
stabilize and restore ankle 
function
Trimalleolar fracture©2017 UpToDate®Metatarsal Fractures
•Fractures of the fifth metatarsal covered 
in other lectures
•Most fractures are stable
•Treated conservatively
•Walking boot/CAM walker
Spine & Pelvis
•Cervical
•Clay Shoveler's
•Hangman
•Fracture/dislocation
•Thoracic & Lumbar
•Compression Fx.
•Lumbar transverse 
process fractures
•Sacrum
•Insufficiency•Pelvic ring

Clay Shoveler’s Fracture
•Hyper-flexion injury in clay miners in the 
1930’s
•Fracture through spinous process typically 
vertebrae C6 to T1
• Stable injury
•Today, this fracture is more commonly seen 
following direct trauma to the spinous 
process and after motor vehicle crashes 
involving sudden deceleration that result in 
forced neck flexion 
Hangman’s Fracture
•Traumatic spondylolysis of C2
•Unstable injury that occurs when the 
cervicocranium (the skull, atlas, & axis 
functioning as a unit) is thrown into extreme 
hyperextension as a result of abrupt 
deceleration
•Treatment:
•Halo vest
•ORIF
C2 pedicle fractures©2017 UpToDate®Fracture Dislocation Of the Spine
•Can occur at any level
•Unstable and frequently 
associated with spinal cord 
lesions
•Usually due to traumatic 
injuries like MVA
•Surgical stabilization and 
supportive care are 
mainstays of treatment
Compression Fractures
•Usually result from compressive failure of the 
anterior column under an axial load applied in 
flexion
•50-70% of thoracic fractures
•Injuries that do not disrupt the posterior 
ligament complex are stable
•Commonly associated with osteoporosis
•Treatment:
•Bracing
•Kyphoplasty
Lumbar Transverse Process Fractures
•Caused by direct trauma to trunk
•Avulsion fracture of the transverse process
•Considered stable but in high velocity 
trauma they maybe associated with other 
injuries so be wary
•Conservative treatment
Pelvic Insufficiency Fractures
•Due to repetitive stresses in osteoporotic 
bone 
•Occur with or without trauma
•These fractures may be either displaced or 
non-displaced & generally involve both 
anterior & posterior elements of the pelvis
•Treatment:
•Pain Control
•Early Mobilization
•Treatment of osteoporosis
Pediatric Fractures
•Periosteum of pediatric bone has significant 
osteogenic potential & is more metabolically active 
•Promotes the healing process so children generally mend 
quicker 
•Pediatric periosteum is also thicker & stronger
•Limits fracture displacement
•↓likelihood of open fractures
•Maintains fracture stability when compared to adults 
•Many pediatric fractures are similar to adults but 
others that are unique to the skeletally immature 
(i.e. Osgood Slater and SCFE that are covered in 
sports injury lecture) and beyond the scope of this 
lecture. Anatomy of the growth plate (physis)
