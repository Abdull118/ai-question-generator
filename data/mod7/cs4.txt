•Describe the warning signs of ocular disease.  
•Discuss the various causes of vision loss, eye pain and 
red eye.
•Discuss clinical presentation, basic treatment and 
indications for referral for common eye emergencies 
and injuries including; corneal abrasions, foreign body 
of the cornea and eyelid, corneal ulcers, chemical 
injuries, detached retina, ruptured globe and hyphema.
•Recognize those conditions that can be treated by 
primary care vs those that require prompt referral to an 
ophthalmologist  
•Briefly discuss clinical presentation of ocular migraines, 
which is not a true ocular emergency.
•Discuss orbital floor fractures and an overview of facial 
fractures and how to properly evaluate and refer the 
same.Reading
•Goldman-Cecil Textbook of Medicine, Goldman, 
26th e, Chap 395, “Diseases of the Visual System”
•Bates’ Guide to Physical Examination and History 
taking, 12th e, Chapter 7Review your anatomy!
•Neuroectoderm:
•Optic Cup
•Retina, iris, & 
ciliary body
•Surface ectoderm
•Lens
•Outer layer of 
cornea
•Mesenchyme
•Inner layer of 
cornea
Always document vision!!
Snellen Visual Acuity
The most common test for visual acuity measures 
the eye’s ability to resolve linear images at a test 
distance of 20 feet (6 meters), approximating 
infinity (parallel rays of light). 
Warning Symptoms!!
•Loss of vision/visual disturbance
•Eye Pain
•Red Eye
History is vital in making an 
accurate diagnosis and prompt 
recognition of an “emergency” 
is paramount to saving 
someone’s eyesight!BE 
AWAREVisual Disturbances
•If only one eye has a change in 
vision
•The problem is most likely in 
that eye (e.g., cataract or 
retinal detachment)
•If both eyes have a change in 
vision
•The problem generally is 
outside of the eye (e.g., 
homonymous hemianopia)
•Improvement of near vision in 
middle age
•May be a sign of cataract 
(“second sight”) or 
hyperglycemia
•Transient complete unilateral 
or bilateral loss of vision
•Think vascular abnormalities 
inside or outside of the eye Differential Diagnosis of Sudden 
Visual Loss
Unilateral Bilateral
•Retinal artery ischemia 
(Amaurosis fugax)•Eclampsia
•Central Retinal Artery 
Occlusion•Vertebrobasilar 
infarct
•Occipital lobe infarct •Trauma
•Ischemic optic 
neuropathy
Hemorrhage:
•Pre-retinal (High 
Altitude, Valsalva)
•Vitreous
•Aqueous (hyphema)
•Trauma
•Detached retina
Adapted from Goldman-Cecil’s Textbook of Medicine, 25e, Chap 423, table 423-2Eye Pain
•Severe eye pain 
associated with a red eye
•acute angle-closure 
glaucoma
•Sharp, intermittent pain
•ocular surface 
abnormalities (e.g., 
corneal foreign body)
•Burning pain that clears 
with blinking
•tear film abnormalities 
(dry eyes)
•Deep boring pain
•most often is associated 
with an ocular 
abnormality (e.g., 
uveitis).  Causes of Eye Pain
Blepharitis Blocked tear 
duct
Chalazion Conjunctivitis
Corneal Abrasion Dry Eyes
Ectropion Entropion
Foreign object Glaucoma
Hordeolum 
(stye)Iritis
Keratoconus Optic Neuritis
Scleritis Trauma
Uveitis
Adapted from Goldman-Cecil’s Textbook of Medicine, 25e, Chap 423, table 423-3Red Eye
•A red or inflamed eye 
can be caused by:
•Conjunctivitis
•Iritis (anterior uveitis)
•Acute glaucoma
•Corneal trauma
•Infection
•Of these causes, all are 
typically painful, with 
the occasional 
exception of 
conjunctivitis
•Know difference 
between ciliary 
injection and 
conjunctival injection!Conjunctival 
InjectionCiliary Injection
•Dilation of the 
conjunctival 
vessels overlying 
the sclera
•Causes: Dry air, 
sun exposure, 
dust, foreign 
body, allergies, 
infection, 
trauma•Involve 
branches of the 
anterior ciliary 
arteries
•“Circumcorneal” 
flush
•Indicates 
inflammation of 
the cornea, iris, 
or ciliary body

4Detached Retina
•Acute visual loss
•Unilateral
•Clinical presentation:
•c/o flashing lights 
(photopsia) followed by 
floaters & then a shade over 
the vision; “cobwebs”
•+/- pupillary defect in the 
involved eye
•Diagnosis:
•Ophthalmoscopy through 
dilated pupil 
•Retina appears elevated 
sometimes with folds and 
choroidal background 
indistinct
•Treatment:
•prompt referral for surgical 
intervention (laser, 
vitrectomy, scleral buckle)
Glaucoma
•Significant cause of blindness in the 
USA
•↑ intraocular pressure(IOP) (normal 
10-21 mmHg)
•Causes optic nerve damage
•Two types:
•Open angle (more common)
•insidious onset (pressure builds up 
slowly!)
•Closed angle (Acute ocular emergency!)
•Acute onset (pressure build up quickly)
•Trabecular meshwork becomes occluded 
by iris tissue
•Clinical findings:
•Pain, nausea & colored halos or 
rainbows around lights
•Red, teary eye with hazy cornea & 
fixed mid-dilated pupil with sudden 
loss of vision
•Eye is firm to palpation
Glaucoma
•Diagnosis:
•Clinical findings!
•Measurement of 
IOP
•Visual field defects
•Ophthalmoscope: 
“cupping” of optic 
nerve (cup:disc 
ratio>0.5)
•Treatment:
•Referral for medical 
treatment & 
surgical 
intervention
Corneal Abrasions/Defects
•Take a good history!!!
•An abrasion/defect may 
be the tip of the iceberg 
as there may be more 
serious ocular injury
•Symptoms
•Sudden pain
•Lacrimation
•Photophobia
•Blurred vision
•Signs
•Ciliary injection
•Irregular light reflex
•Fluorescein staining 
positive 
Corneal Abrasions/Defects
Treatment:
•Topical antibiotics
•Cycloplegic agents
•Places the ciliary body & 
iris at rest
•Helps with pain control
•e.g., Atropine, 
Homatropine, 
Scopolamine, 
Cyclopentolate, 
Tropicamide
•Patch
•May decrease the pain of 
large corneal abrasions
•Patching is not 
recommended for small 
abrasions
Steven Sherman, D.O., M.S., FOCOO, FACSForeign Bodies
•Signs & symptoms 
similar to corneal 
abrasions
•Try to irrigate out
•May be able to remove 
with cotton tip 
applicator if not 
penetrating
•Cover with topical 
antibiotic
•Need follow up with 
ophthalmologist
•May need to use a 27 
gauge needle with a slit 
lamp to remove
Corneal Ulcers
•A corneal ulcer is an 
open sore in the outer 
layer of the cornea
•It is often caused by 
infection
•Pseudomonas ulcer 
may perforate in 24- 
hours
•Needs Prompt 
Ophthalmologic 
Consult
•If patient wearing a 
contact lens remove it 
and send for culture
Chemical Injuries
Cannot wait!! 
Must Irrigate!!
•Alkali worse than 
Acid
•Treat immediately– 
Irrigation, irrigation…
•If patient calls from 
home- start 
treatment at home– 
go to a sink, into a 
shower
•Extensive Irrigation.
•Do it, do it again, & 
again…Slide credit: Steven Sherman, D.O., M.S., FOCOO, FACSSteven Sherman, D.O., M.S., FOCOO, FACS
Hyphema
•A hyphema is a 
collection of blood 
inside the anterior 
chamber (space 
between the cornea & 
the iris)
•The blood may cover 
part or all of the iris & 
the pupil, and may 
partly or totally block 
vision in that eye
•Usually, a result of 
direct trauma to the 
eye or surgery
•May cause increased 
intraocular pressure
•Needs referral
Ruptured Globe
•Seek Immediate 
Ophthalmology 
Consult!
•No pressure on 
the eye
•Protect the eye 
with a shield 
only
•Iris points to the 
rupture    
•Rupture may be 
under a muscle 
and not visible
Ophthalmic Migraines
•NOT an emergency but the 
patients thinks it is!
•Most common 
ophthalmic “emergency”
•Bilateral image that comes 
on suddenly and lasts 
typically < 30 min
•Described as “flashing”, 
“scintillating”, ,”pulsing”, 
“vibrating”, “prismatic” 
•Not retinal in nature
•can see it with eyes 
closed
•Due to vasospasm of 
occipital lobe vessel
•5% have associated 
headache
RECAP:  Ocular 
Emergencies
•Very common in an ER and office setting
•Document the patient’s vision!!
•Recognize the common ones discussed 
and how to initiate treatment.
•Know when to refer to an 
ophthalmologist and when in doubt, call 
to discuss!
Making an accurate diagnosis and prompt 
recognition of an “emergency” is paramount to 
saving someone’s eye sight!Facial TraumaFacial Trauma
Trauma causing 
facial fractures 
and/or soft tissue 
injuries will 
probably have 
some type of 
traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) as well.

•Nasal bone x-rays NOT 
indicated when:
•Tenderness & swelling are 
isolated to the bony bridge of the 
nose
•The patient can breathe through 
each nares
•The nose is straight (i.e., no 
deviation of the septum)
•No septal hematoma is present
•CT scan remains the preferred 
means of imaging facial trauma 
& should be obtained if 
concern exists about more 
extensive injury in the vicinity 
of the nose

Nasal Bone Fractures
•Initial treatment:
•Ice & head elevation
•Displaced but 
otherwise 
uncomplicated nasal 
fractures evaluated 
within six hours of 
injury are reduced 
immediately
•Isolated nasal fractures 
older than 10 days are 
referred to an 
otolaryngologist for 
outpatient 
management
Orbital Floor Fractures
•“Blow-out” fracture
•Occurs when small round object strikes the eye
•Sign & Symptoms
•Periorbital edema
•Crepitus
•Ecchymosis
•Enophthalmos
•Diplopia
•Restriction in upward & lateral gaze
•Due to entrapment of the medial rectus, inferior 
rectus, and inferior oblique muscles
•Paresthesia or anesthesia of the lateral side of 
the nose, upper lip & maxillary gingiva on the 
affected side
•Due to injury to the infraorbital nerve
•Restriction in upward & 
lateral gaze
•Due to entrapment of the 
medial rectus, inferior 
rectus, and inferior 
oblique muscles
Orbital Floor Fractures
•Diagnosis:
•Made by clinical findings and radiographic 
findings
•CT scan of facial bones (Most common)
•Plain x-rays
Steven Sherman, D.O., M.S., FOCOO, FACSOrbital Floor Fractures
Treatment:
•Depends on severity
•Prophylactic antibiotics for sinus pathology
•No nose blowing
•Make follow up with ophthalmology
•Surgery if large defect in orbital floor
