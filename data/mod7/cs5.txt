Neuro-Ophthalmology:
Extraocular Muscles & 
Disorders of Gaze
Alexandra Pappas, MD
Clinical Systems 
Touro COM, Middletown, NYObjectives
1.Review general anatomy of the eye.
2.Discuss and define terminology used to 
address eye movements.
3.Discuss and define extraocular muscle 
movements and associated cranial nerves.
4.Define ptosis and strabismus
5.Describe nuclear, internuclear and 
supranuclear pathways and common disorders 
of oculomotor control.
6.Define disorders of gaze including, 
internuclear ophthalmoplegia & disorders of 
conjugated gaze.Reading

http://www.biographixmedia.com/human/eye-anatomy.htmlEye Movement: Extraocular Muscles
Nerve Muscle
Cranial Nerve III •Medial Rectus : adducts eye
•Superior Rectus : elevates, intorts, adducts eye
•Inferior Rectus: depresses, extorts, adducts eye
•Inferior Oblique: elevates, extorts, abducts eye
•Levator palpebrae: elevates upper eye lid
Cranial Nerve IV •Superior Oblique: depresses, intorts, abducts eye
Cranial Nerve VI •Lateral Rectus: abducts eyeLateral Rectus
•Contraction of the lateral rectus 
muscle moves the eye so that 
the cornea is directed laterally 
(abducted)
•Innervated by Cranial Nerve VIMedial Rectus
•The medial rectus muscle 
moves the eye so that the 
cornea is directed medially 
(adducted)
•The two medial recti muscles 
acting together are 
responsible for convergence
•Innervated by Cranial Nerve 
IIISuperior Rectus
•Moves the eye so that the cornea is 
directed upwards (elevation) and 
medially (adduction)
•To obtain upward movement alone, 
the muscle must function with the 
inferior oblique muscle
•Causes intorsion of the eye, i.e. 
medial rotation
•Because a check ligament extends 
from the muscle to the levator 
palpebrae superioris muscle, 
elevation of the cornea also results in 
elevation of the upper eyelid
•Innervated by cranial nerve IIIInferior Rectus
•Moves the eye so that the cornea is 
directed downwards (depression)
•The muscle also causes the cornea to 
deviate medially
•To obtain downward movement alone, 
the muscle must function with the 
superior oblique muscle
•The inferior rectus muscle is responsible 
for extorsion of the eye, lateral rotation
•A check ligament passes from the inferior 
rectus muscle to the inferior tarsal plate 
of the eyelid. This causes the lower eyelid 
to be slightly depressed when the inferior 
rectus muscle contracts
•Innervated by Cranial Nerve IIISuperior Oblique
•Insertion into the posterior part of 
the eye
•Contraction elevates the back of the 
eye  causing depression of the 
cornea, particularly with the eye in 
the adducted position
•It also contributes to abduction of the 
eye along with the obliquus inferior & 
lateral rectus muscles
•Innervated Cranial Nerve IV
Inferior Oblique
•Depresses the posterior aspect of the 
eye & therefore elevates the direction 
of the cornea
•Along with the superior oblique 
muscle and lateral rectus it also 
contributes to abduction of the eye
•Innervation Cranial Nerve III
Ptosis
Also referred to as blepharoptosis, is 
defined as an abnormal low-lying upper 
eyelid margin with the eye in primary 
gaze.

“Squint” –  “Misaligned Eyes”
Exotropia (XT) Divergent squint

•Two important eye movements:
•Abduction (CNVI)
•Adduction (CNIII)
•Conjugate Gaze (eyes move together)
•Oculomotor & Abducens nerves 
interconnected by Medial Longitudinal 
Fasciculus (MLF)
•Horizontal Gaze controlled by Two 
Gaze centers
•Frontal eye field (contralateral)
•Paramedial pontine reticular formation 
(PPRF) (ipsilateral)
