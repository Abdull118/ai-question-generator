1.Review and define miosis, mydriasis, 
accommodation, scotoma, hemiopia and 
congruence vs. incongruence. 
2.Review and describe anatomy of the afferent 
visual pathways.
3.Recognize common disorders of the pupils such 
as Horner’s syndrome, Marcus Gunn pupils and 
Adie’s pupil.
4.Recognize visual field defects as well as lesions 
causing the defects.
5.Recognize common causes of visual loss related 
to the eye, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract 
and the occipital cortex.Terminology
1.Miosis vs Mydriasis
2.Accommodation
3.Scotoma
4.Hemianopia
5.Homonymous hemianopia
6.Bitemporal (heteronymous hemianopia) 
7.Congruent vs. IncongruentMiosis Constriction of the pupil of the 
eye
Mydriasis Dilation of the pupil of the eye

•Parasympathetic fibers contract ciliary muscles
•Relaxation of suspensory ligaments
•Lens become more round (↑convexity)
•Refractive index increases, focusing nearby 
objects on retina
Scotoma 
A partial loss of vision or a blind spot 
in an otherwise normal visual field.
Hemianopia •Loss of half the visual 
field
Homonymous 
hemianopia•Loss of either the right 
or left half of the 
visual field in either 
eye
Bitemporal 
(heteronymous 
hemianopia)•Loss of the temporal 
half of the visual field 
in each eye 
Congruous
(Congruent)Homonymous defects in fields of 
both eyes are identical in shape, 
depth and size 
©2017 UpToDateIncongruous
(Incongruent)Incomplete homonymous 
hemianopias where the visual 
field defects in both eyes are not 
identical in shape, depth or size

Optic Nerve
Pupillary Light Reflex 
Pathway
Pupillary responses associated 
with lesions of the:
1.Optic nerve
2.Pretectum
3.Oculomotor nerve
•Baseline is obtained with 
fixation on a distant target and 
the near response with a 
target in front of the nose.
http://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/NeurLrngObjectives/visual%20path.jpgPupillary Light Reflex 
Pathway
Afferent Limb – Cranial Nerve II
•Light stimulates ganglion reflex 
and impulse travels up CNII 
which projects bilaterally to 
the pretectal nuclei in the mid-
brain
•The pretectal nuclei projects 
bilaterally to the Edinger-
Westphal nuclei (CNIII)
http://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/NeurLrngObjectives/visual%20path.jpgPupillary Light Reflex 
Pathway
Efferent Limb – Cranial Nerve III
•Edinger-Westphal nucleus 
(preganglionic 
parasympathetic) projects to 
the ciliary ganglion 
(postganglionic 
parasympathetic)
•The ciliary ganglion projects to 
the pupillary sphincter muscle 
causing miosis
http://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/NeurLrngObjectives/visual%20path.jpgRelative Afferent Pupil
(Marcus Gunn)
•Lesion of afferent limb of pupillary reflex
•Diagnosis made with swinging flashlight:
1.Shining light in MG pupil→ pupils do not constrict
2.Shine light in normal eye→ pupils constrict fully
3.Shine light immediately again in affected eye→ 
apparent dilation of both pupils because stimulus 
carried thru CN II is weaker
•Indicates lesions of the optic nerve on affected 
side
•e.g. Multiple Sclerosis
Argyll Robertson Pupil
•No direct or consensual light reflex
•Accommodation - Convergence intact
•Seen in:
•Neurosyphillis
•Diabetes
Horner Syndrome
•Caused by lesion of the oculosympathetic pathway
•Clinically:
1.Miosis
2.Ptosis
3.Hemi-anhidrosis
4.Apparent enophthalmos
Classic TriadAdie Pupil
•Dilated pupil that reacts sluggishly to light but 
better to accommodation
•Often seen in young women & associated with 
loss of knee jerk (Holmes- Adie syndrome)
Transtentorial (Uncal) Herniation
•Increased intracranial pressure
•CN III compressed
•Fixed & dilated pupils; “down & out” eye, ptosis
Visual System
•Lens inverts the image of the visual 
field
•Nasal retina receives information 
from the temporal visual field
•Temporal retina receives information 
from the nasal visual field
•Optic nerve fibers from the nasal 
half of each retina cross at the optic 
chiasm and project to the 
contralateral optic tract
Brodmann Area 17Visual Information from lower retina (upper 
contralateral visual field) projects to temporal 
lobe (Meyer’s loop) to the lingua gyrus
Visual information from the upper retina (lower 
contralateral visual field) projects to the parietal 
lobe and the cuneus gyrusVisual Field Defects
1.Optic nerve: 
•Clinical Presentation:
•Unilateral Amaurosis
•Causes:
•Optic Neuritis
•Central retinal artery 
occlusion
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
2.Lateral Optic Chiasm
•Clinical Presentation:
•Grossly incongruous
•Incomplete (contralateral) 
homonymous hemianopia
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
3.Central Optic Chiasm
•Clinical Presentation
•Bitemporal hemianopia
•Common Causes:
•Pituitary adenoma
•Craniopharyngioma
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
4.Optic tract
•Clinical Presentation:
•Incongruous
•Incomplete homonymous 
hemianopia
•Common Cause
•Internal carotid artery 
aneurysm
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
5.Temporal (Meyer's) Loop 
of the Optic Radiation
•Clinical Presentation:
•Congruous
•Partial or complete 
(contralateral) 
homonymous superior 
quadrantanopia
•“Pie in the Sky”
Meyer's loop has been cut on 
the right, so vision will be lost 
in the upper visual world, but 
only in the left hemifield
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
6.Parietal (superior) 
projection of the optic 
radiation: 
•Clinical Presentation:
•Congruous 
•Partial or complete 
homonymous inferior 
quadrantanopia
Here the parietal portion of 
the optic radiations were cut 
on the right, so you would 
affect the lower visual world 
on one side.
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
7.Complete Parieto-
Occipital interruption of 
the Optic Radiation:
•Clinical Presentation:
•Complete congruous 
homonymous hemianopia
•When cortex itself is lesioned the 
Vision at the fovea is spared.
•The loss of vision is not a 
complete hemifield, but a 
notched hemifield
•This phenomenon is called 
“macular sparing” 
Goldman-Cecil; FIGURE 424-1Visual Field Defects
8.Incomplete damage to 
the visual cortex
•Clinical Presentation:
•Congruous homonymous 
scotomas
• Usually encroaching at 
least acutely on central 
vision.
