associated with nausea and/or vomiting, and accompanied by photophobia 
and phonophobia. The headache occurs anytime and persists from 4 to 72 
hours. It may occur with or without an aura (a focal neurologic symptom that 
may be visual, sensory, or motor). Visual auras may have positive (photopsias) 
and negative (scotomas) features.
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
The prevalence of migraine is 15 to 20% in women and 4 to 7% in men. In children the prevalence may be as high as 17% and is equal in boys and girls. 
At puberty, the prevalence rises in girls and remains higher throughout their 
lifespan. The highest prevalence occurs between the ages of 25 and 55. Migraine with aura affects 5% of the adult population, and 90% of auras are visual. Migraine is more prevalent in white persons and in those with a lower socio -
economic status or income.
Comorbid conditions that may be associated with migraine headache include 
epilepsy, stroke, depression, anxiety, myocardial infarction, patent foramen ovale, Raynaud phenomenon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pain disorders 
such as fibromyalgia. Menstruation and ovulation may increase the frequency 
of headache. PREVENTION
Preventive medications are recommended when headaches are frequent or severe enough to interfere with quality of life. The choice of medications 
should be based on the type of headache (migraine, tension-type), their side 
effect profiles, and the patient’s comorbid conditions (T able 370-3).
 PROGNOSIS
The natural history of headache depends on many factors, including the type of headache, comorbid conditions that accompany the headache, and success 
of treatment.
4 Risk factors for chronic headache include female sex, migraine-
type headaches, frequent headaches, obesity, low education and socioeconomic level, overuse of medication, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, and sleep 
apnea.
 MIGRAINE HEADACHE
 DEFINITION
Migraine is an inherited headache disorder that is typically unilateral but sometimes bilateral, moderate to severe, worsens by routine physical activity, 370  
HEADACHES AND OTHER HEAD PAIN
KATHLEEN B. DIGRE
 DEFINITION
Headache, which is a very common symptom, can be secondary to an underly -
ing abnormality but is usually a primary headache disorder such as migraine 
headache, tension-type headache, cluster headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania.
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
About 90% of all adults experience headache at some time in their lives, and 
over 75% of children have complained of headaches by the age of 15 years. 
In the United States, the direct and indirect costs associated with migraine 
are over $20 billion annually. The World Health Organization lists migraine in the top 10 most disabling conditions. Patients at most risk for lost days of employment are those with chronic migraine and daily headache.
In large population-based studies, the relative risk of having migraine, tension-
type headaches, or cluster headaches increases up to four times if a first-degree relative has the same kind of headaches. Studies of twins, especially identical twins, also show a similar susceptibility.
 PATHOBIOLOGY
Headache pain is initiated by primary trigeminal afferents that innervate the blood vessels, mucosa, muscles, and tissues. Fibers from these sources coalesce 
in the trigeminal ganglion, especially the first division. The trigeminal afferents 
terminate in the primary sensory nucleus of cranial nerve V and its spinal nucleus, which has several small subnuclei, the most important of which is the subnucleus caudalis. This subnucleus receives afferents from meningeal 
vessels, dura-sensitive neurons, and even the upper cervical cord and then 
projects them to the lateral and medial thalamus by way of the spinothalamic tract and to diencephalic and brain stem regions that are involved in the regu -
lation of autonomic functions. Thalamic nociceptive information ascends to 
the sensory cortex, as well as to other areas of the brain.
Although secondary headaches may stimulate the pathway by way of processes 
such as inflammation and compression, primary headache disorders occur 
spontaneously by means of chemical mediators such as calcitonin gene–related 
peptide. The sequence of events commences with peripheral activation caused 
by neurogenic plasma extravasation activated spontaneously or by cortical spreading depression. The trigeminocervical complex, especially the nucleus caudalis, is then activated, and patients can experience allodynia, a condition 
in which a non-noxious stimulus is sensed as painful.
Aura is defined as a focal visual, sensory, or motor neurologic disturbance 
that may occur with or without headache. Aura is thought to occur when cortical spreading depression causes depolarization of membranes. Both neurons 
and glia can mediate both constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Migraine headache clearly has a genetic component. Familial hemiplegic migraine can be caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene, which is located on chromo -
some 19p13.2-p13.1 and encodes for voltage-gated neuronal calcium channels. Mutations in the CACNA1A gene also cause episodic ataxia and epilepsy. 
Another mutation is in ATP1A2, also called the familial hemiplegia migraine 
2 (FHM2 ) gene, which is located on chromosome 1q21-q23 and encodes for 
the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na
+,K+-ATPase) transport 
protein. A third genetic locus is the SCN1A gene on chromosome 2q24.3, 
which is a voltage-gated sodium channel. In addition, many single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with migraine.
1 Although there are link -
ages to many genetic loci for more common forms of migraine, migraine and 
other headaches also probably have multiple epigenetic interactions2 with 
environmental factors, and it is clear that the genetic contributions are complex.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Patients with headache may describe the pain as throbbing, bandlike, or aching. 
The pain is frequently unilateral but can be bilateral. Migraine headache is 
often associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. It is 
invariably moderate to severe and interferes with activities. Other autonomic manifestations that can accompany migraine, cluster, and other headache vari -
ants include ptosis, conjunctival injection, tearing, rhinorrhea, Horner syndrome, and facial edema. Secondary headaches sometimes may appear to be similar to tension-type or migraine headaches, but “red flags” may suggest 
a secondary rather than a primary headache disorder ( T able 370-1). Particular 
attention should be paid to the sudden onset of severe headaches, which fre -
quently have an underlying secondary cause.

 DIAGNOSIS
Five elements of the history are key for evaluating headaches. The family 
history helps determine whether a person has a genetic predisposition to 
headache. The life history of headache determines whether the headache is 
new or has evolved over the course of a lifetime. The attack history provides the clinical features of the headache or headaches. The medical and psychiatric history determines whether there are comorbid conditions that can cause or 
worsen the headache. The medication and drug history determines whether 
the headache could be caused by or worsened by medications or drugs the person has ingested.
Diagnosis of the type of headache is based on the type of pain, the duration 
of headache, and accompanying features ( T able 370-2). Secondary headaches 
are usually due to an underlying condition such as a brain tumor (Chapter 180), increased or low intracranial pressure, sinus disease (Chapter 398), or a vascular malformation (Chapter 380); on removing the cause, the headache 
generally improves. Headaches that occur at a frequency of less than 15 days 
a month are called episodic, whereas headaches that occur more than 15 days a month are considered chronic.
The diagnostic evaluation for headache depends on the clinical findings. If 
the history is typical and if the neurologic examination is completely normal, no further evaluation is needed. The features of the history that are most likely to predict migraine headache without a secondary disorder include photo -
phobia, nausea, and disabling nature. However, if there are atypical features of the history or any abnormality on neurologic examination, further evalu -
ation is indicated. Patients with cluster headache types and headaches of undetermined cause need imaging to exclude secondary causes.
In patients with acute onset headache, computed tomography (CT) is best 
for assessing acute hemorrhage as the cause of the headache, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is best for assessing most persistent headaches to look for mass lesions, evidence of intracranial hypertension or hypotension, 
hemosiderin (old hemorrhage), and congenital abnormalities (e.g., Chiari 
malformation). In individuals older than 60 years with an unexplained new or unusual headache, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) level should be measured to evaluate for giant cell 
arteritis (Chapter 69). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including opening 
pressure, protein, glucose, cells, culture, and cytology, is indicated in patients with suspected intracranial hypertension or meningitis.TABLE 370-1  REASONS  FOR FURTHER EVALUATION TO 
LOOK FOR SECONDARY HEADACHES
Beginning of headaches at an older age, without a previous history or a positive 
family history
Unexplainable and abnormal worsening of previously existing migraines
Dramatic or unusual change in character of the prodrome or the headache previously 
present
Headaches awakening the patient in the middle of the night (except for a cluster 
headache)
Headaches much worse when recumbent, only when upright, or with coughing, 
sneezing, or the Valsalva maneuver
Unusually severe headache of sudden onset (“worst headache of my life”)Focal deficits that do not disappear after the headache is overAny abnormal neurologic or new psychiatric finding on examinationA new headache in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection, 
malignancy, or pregnancy
Treatment of acute headache depends on the type and severity of the head -
ache. For mild headaches, simple analgesics such as acetaminophen A1  (500 to 
1000  mg), acetaminophen with caffeine, aspirin (250 to 1000  mg), A2  and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs A3  ([NSAIDs]; e.g., ibuprofen, 400 to 800  mg;  
naproxen sodium, 220 to 500  mg, diclofenac 50-100  mg) will suffice.TREATMENT

trigeminal neuralgia ABSTRACT
Headache is an extremely common symptom, which can have multiple causes. 
Although secondary causes of headache should be considered, the most common 
types of headache are migraine, tension, cluster, and medication-overuse 
headaches. Each type of headache has different treatments, so accurate diag -
nosis is critical. Patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias should undergo 
imaging at the time of diagnosis, because many secondary headaches mimic 
this phenotype. Two common secondary headaches are idiopathic intracranial 
hypertension (seen in obese women in their child-bearing years) and intra -
cranial hypotension (or hypovolemia). Both conditions have imaging char -
acteristics that can be helpful in making the correct diagnosis.

<15 days per month) or chronic (occurring >15 days per month). In many 
patients headaches remain episodic, but about 25% progress to chronic head -
ache. Of the patients with chronic tension-type headache, about a quarter to a 
third continue as chronic, half can improve to episodic, and in about a quarter medication overuse headache can develop. Episodic tension-type headaches can last minutes, hours, or days.
 DIAGNOSIS
Headaches that can be misdiagnosed as tension-type headache include migraine, hemicrania continua, new daily persistent headache, and headaches caused 
by brain tumors, elevated or low intracranial pressure, or giant cell arteritis. 
A careful history is the best way to distinguish other types of headaches.
 PREVENTION
Preventive treatment (see T able 370-3) is often recommended when the headaches interfere with activities on 3 or more days per month, the head -
aches are severe or prolonged, or migraine is complicated by events such as cerebral infarction. Prophylactic options include β-adrenergic blockers, 
calcium-channel antagonists, NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, valproate, and topiramate. T opiramate, divalproex, timolol, propranolol, metoprolol, 
atenolol, nadolol, acebutolol, captopril, lisinopril, and candesartan reduce 
migraine frequency by 50% or more compared with placebo, with no statis -
tically significant differences among them.
 A9  Other alternatives include the 
serotonergic drug cyproheptadine (4 to 20 mg) or the monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor phenelzine (30 to 60 mg). Acupuncture and biofeedback have been 
used successfully. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection is also effective for prophylaxis of chronic migraine.
 A10   Supraorbital nerve stimulation A11   also is approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent migraines. A new and 
very promising approach is calcitonin gene–related peptide antibodies.8 Ere -
numab is currently approved (70 to 140 mg subcutaneously monthly), A12  , A13   and  
similarly beneficial results have been seen with fremanezumab (225 mg sub -
cutaneously monthly or 675 mg quarterly) A14  , A15   and galcanezumab (240 mg 
loading and 120 mg monthly). A16  
 PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for patients with migraine is variable. In many patients, head -
aches decrease in severity with age, but migraine aura without headache becomes more frequent with older age. Modification of inciting factors such as avoiding 
dietary triggers (tyramine, phenylethylamine, ethanol), ameliorating or pre -
venting insomnia, and averting environmental triggers (light, sound, odor) may improve outcome. Migraines may become chronic, defined as more than 
15 days per month, especially when associated with obesity, snoring, depres -
sion, and low socioeconomic status. Since there appears to be shared genetic 
susceptibility to migraine with aura and ischemic stroke, careful attention to cardiovascular risk factors is important.
 TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE
 DEFINITION
T ension-type headache is defined as a mild or moderate holocranial headache without nausea or vomiting. Patients may have either photophobia or pho -
nophobia but not both, and the headache does not worsen with activity.
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
The 1-year prevalence is 14 to 93 per 100,000 individuals for episodic tension-type headache and 8.1 per 100,000 for chronic tension-type headache. T ension-
type headaches are more common in women than in men, regardless of age, 
race, and educational level. T ension-type headaches are more common in Western countries and less frequent in Asian countries, and they are more common in white persons than in African Americans.
 PATHOBIOLOGY
The pathophysiology of tension-type headache is less well understood than that of the other types of headache. Myofascial tenderness is increased, espe-
cially in chronic tension-type headache. Genetic factors are uncertain. Migraine 
and tension-type headache often coexist. Although tension-type headaches are not due to emotion or muscle contraction, triggers of a tension-type head -
ache are similar to those associated with migraine: stress, fatigue, and lack of 
sleep. Comorbid conditions in patients with tension-type headache include 
depression and anxiety in more than 50% of individuals.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
T ension-type headaches are usually mild to moderate in severity, and most individuals do not seek care. T ension-type headache can be episodic (occurring TABLE 370-4  SPECIFIC  TRIPTAN MEDICATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE MIGRAINE

The aura of a migraine headache is thought to be due in part to cortical spreading 
depression, which is associated with a brief reduction in blood flow followed 
by hyperemia.5 These changes do not seem to correlate with the phase of the 
headache. Pain occurs when trigeminal afferents of the dura are stimulated.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Migraine headache often begins with a prodrome that may persist for hours 
to days, when patients note difficulty concentrating or fatigue without head -
ache. An aura may or may not occur but is generally present before the headache begins. The headache may be unilateral or bilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, and worsened with activity. Accompanying clinical features include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Other clinical features 
include neck pain, occasionally dizziness, osmophobia (sensitivity to odors), 
and difficulty thinking clearly.
The migraine aura is generally visual but can be sensory or include aphasia 
or vertigo. Migraine aura without headache begins with a neurologic distur -
bance (e.g., a visual phenomenon), but without a subsequent headache. Although an aura is traditionally thought to precede the headache, it can be present during the headache phase.
 DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of migraine is based on the history. The differential diagnosis includes tension-type headache, but most moderate to severe headaches are 
migraine.
6 In patients with a history suggestive of a secondary headache, further 
evaluation with MRI should be considered (see T able 370-2). However, if the headache is typical of migraine and the findings on neurologic examination 
are normal, no further studies are needed.
Treatment of migraine is divided into treatment of the acute headache and 
prevention of subsequent migraine attacks. Acute treatment is most effectively 
accomplished with migraine-specific care: a nonspecific analgesic agent or combination analgesic therapy for milder migraine, and most frequently aggres -
sive migraine-specific therapy for migraine ( Table 370-4). For example, mild TREATMENT  attacks can generally be treated successfully with over-the-counter analgesics 
such as acetaminophen (suggested dose, 650 to 1000  mg) or NSAIDs (aspir in, 
250 mg to 1000  mg; ibuprofen, 1000 to 1200  mg; naproxen, 500 to 825  mg; 
diclofenac 50  mg , or ketoprofen, 75  mg). I f the migraine headaches are moder -
ate to severe, patients benefit from migraine-specific therapies (see Table 370-4) 
such as triptans (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, naratriptan, frovatriptan, and eletriptan), ergotamine (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine tar -
trate), or isometheptene,
7 and the combination of naproxen plus sumatriptan 
may be better than either alone A4  (see Table 370-4).
During pregnancy, mild to moderate attacks can be treated with acetamino -
phen. Moderate headaches may respond to the combination of acetaminophen, 
isometheptene mucate (a mild vasoconstrictor, 65  mg), and dichlor alphenazone 
(a mild sedative, 100  mg). A ntinausea agents include prochlorperazine (10 to 
25 mg) and metoclopramide (2.5 to 10  mg).
Stratification of care, including tailoring the treatment according to the type 
of headache, results in fewer days of disability and use of medications. Which migraine-specific drug will work for any individual patient depends on the patient. It is important to avoid overuse of analgesic and other medications (especially opiates) because overuse can cause chronic daily headache in sus -
ceptible individuals. Prompt treatment improves the outcome of headache when compared with late treatment. Contraindications to use of triptans (see Table 370-4) include uncontrolled hypertension, clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, and Prinzmetal angina.
Opioids such as N-acetyl- p-aminophenol (APAP) with codeine, or butorphanol, 
benefit some patients, but meperidine is not effective. Oral opiates should not be used for chronic recurrent, primary headaches, although sometimes opiates 
(e.g., acetaminophen, 325  mg , with codeine, 30  mg) are often the only option 
during pregnancy or in patients with severe vascular disease. When opiates are used, caution is required, and the associated risks of rebound headache and dependency must be recognized by both the patient and physician. Bar -
biturates (with caffeine and aspirin or acetaminophen) have not been efficacious in controlled trials but may be helpful in individual patients in whom other migraine-specific drugs cannot be used or are contraindicated.
For moderate to severe attacks, options include dihydroergotamine (1 to 
2 mg in tranasally); oral, intranasal, or subcutaneous administration of sumat -
riptan (25 to 100  mg orally, 20  mg intranasally, or 4 to 6  mg subcutaneously); 
or other triptans (e.g., naratriptan, 2.5  mg; z olmitriptan, 5  mg; r izatriptan, 10  mg;  
eletriptan, 40  mg; fr ovatriptan, 2.5  mg; or almotr iptan, 12.5  mg). A5  Ergotamine 
(2 mg sublingually or 1 t o 2  mg or ally), when given early in the migraine attack, 
can be effective if the associated nausea and peripheral vasoconstriction are tolerable. PREVENTION
Chronic tension-type headaches may benefit from prophylactic treatment 
with amitriptyline (starting with 10 mg at bedtime and increased slowly up to 
100 mg until the patient improves or intolerable side effects develop), nortrip -
tyline (25 to 100 mg each evening), doxepin (25 to 75 mg/day), maprotiline 
(10 to 25/mg/day), or fluoxetine (10 to 20 mg/day). T ricyclics are gener -
ally more efficacious than serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A17   Muscle relaxants, 
physical therapy, localized botulinum toxin injection, and acupuncture can  
be useful. A18  
 PROGNOSIS
T ension-type headache has a variable prognosis. Adolescents with tension-
type headache and two or more psychiatric factors (e.g., depression and anxiety) 
have a worse prognosis.

T rigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, including cluster headaches, are unilateral 
headaches associated with ipsilateral autonomic features. Other trigeminal 
autonomic cephalalgias include paroxysmal hemicrania, which is characterized 
by bouts of headache that persist for 5 to 30 minutes, is generally unilateral, and usually occurs in women; they typically respond to indomethacin. Hemi -
crania continua, another indomethacin-responsive headache seen in both men 
and women, is characterized by continuous unilateral pain and mild associated 
autonomic features; it frequently coexists with a form of chronic daily head -
ache. Short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing is a rare trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia that occurs in men; individual 
headaches persist for only a short time (seconds to 2 minutes).
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
Cluster headache occurs in 56 to 401 per 100,000 persons and is more frequent 
in men (3 : 1 to 7 : 1). Attacks usually begin between 20 and 30 years of age. 
Paroxysmal hemicrania occurs in 56 to 381 per 100,000 persons; it affects 
women more often (2 : 1) and can begin at any age but usually commences 
at 34 to 41 years. Short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival 
injection and tearing is rare, with a slight male preponderance (2 : 1).
 PATHOBIOLOGY
Cluster headache may have a genetic predisposition. Imaging studies such as 
positron emission tomography and functional MRI show inferior posterior 
hypothalamic activation at the onset of cluster headache and other trigeminal 
autonomic cephalalgias. In addition, the trigeminovascular complex and the cranial autonomic system are activated. The pathophysiology of hemicrania continua is unknown, and there is debate whether it is associated with hypo -
thalamic involvement or whether it resembles migraine.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Cluster headache is almost always unilateral, rarely bilateral, and has charac -
teristic ipsilateral autonomic features, commonly including lacrimation and

<15 days per month) or chronic (occurring >15 days per month). In many 
patients headaches remain episodic, but about 25% progress to chronic head -
ache. Of the patients with chronic tension-type headache, about a quarter to a 
third continue as chronic, half can improve to episodic, and in about a quarter medication overuse headache can develop. Episodic tension-type headaches can last minutes, hours, or days.
 DIAGNOSIS
Headaches that can be misdiagnosed as tension-type headache include migraine, hemicrania continua, new daily persistent headache, and headaches caused 
by brain tumors, elevated or low intracranial pressure, or giant cell arteritis. 
A careful history is the best way to distinguish other types of headaches.
 PREVENTION
Preventive treatment (see T able 370-3) is often recommended when the headaches interfere with activities on 3 or more days per month, the head -
aches are severe or prolonged, or migraine is complicated by events such as cerebral infarction. Prophylactic options include β-adrenergic blockers, 
calcium-channel antagonists, NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, valproate, and topiramate. T opiramate, divalproex, timolol, propranolol, metoprolol, 
atenolol, nadolol, acebutolol, captopril, lisinopril, and candesartan reduce 
migraine frequency by 50% or more compared with placebo, with no statis -
tically significant differences among them.
 A9  Other alternatives include the 
serotonergic drug cyproheptadine (4 to 20  m g) or the monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor phenelzine (30 to 60  m g). Acupuncture and biofeedback have been 
used successfully. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection is also effective for prophylaxis of chronic migraine.
 A10   Supraorbital nerve stimulation A11   also is approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent migraines. A new and 
very promising approach is calcitonin gene–related peptide antibodies.8 Ere -
numab is currently approved (70 to 140  m g subcutaneously monthly), A12  , A13   and  
similarly beneficial results have been seen w ith f remanezumab (225  m g sub -
cutaneously monthly or 675  m g quarterly) A14  , A15   and galcanezumab (240  m g 
loading and 120  mg monthly). A16  
 PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for patients with migraine is variable. In many patients, head -
aches decrease in severity with age, but migraine aura without headache becomes more frequent with older age. Modification of inciting factors such as avoiding 
dietary triggers (tyramine, phenylethylamine, ethanol), ameliorating or pre -
venting insomnia, and averting environmental triggers (light, sound, odor) may improve outcome. Migraines may become chronic, defined as more than 
15 days per month, especially when associated with obesity, snoring, depres -
sion, and low socioeconomic status. Since there appears to be shared genetic 
susceptibility to migraine with aura and ischemic stroke, careful attention to cardiovascular risk factors is important.
 TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE
 DEFINITION
T ension-type headache is defined as a mild or moderate holocranial headache without nausea or vomiting. Patients may have either photophobia or pho -
nophobia but not both, and the headache does not worsen with activity.
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
The 1-year prevalence is 14 to 93 per 100,000 individuals for episodic tension-type headache and 8.1 per 100,000 for chronic tension-type headache. T ension-
type headaches are more common in women than in men, regardless of age, 
race, and educational level. T ension-type headaches are more common in Western countries and less frequent in Asian countries, and they are more common in white persons than in African Americans.
 PATHOBIOLOGY
The pathophysiology of tension-type headache is less well understood than that of the other types of headache. Myofascial tenderness is increased, espe-
cially in chronic tension-type headache. Genetic factors are uncertain. Migraine 
and tension-type headache often coexist. Although tension-type headaches are not due to emotion or muscle contraction, triggers of a tension-type head -
ache are similar to those associated with migraine: stress, fatigue, and lack of 
sleep. Comorbid conditions in patients with tension-type headache include 
depression and anxiety in more than 50% of individuals.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
T ension-type headaches are usually mild to moderate in severity, and most individuals do not seek care. T ension-type headache can be episodic (occurring Episodic tension-type headaches are generally treated successfully9 with 
acetaminophen (650 to 1000  m g) or NSAIDs (aspirin, 250 to 1000  m g; naproxen, 
250 to 500  mg; ibupr ofen, 200 to 800  mg; or ket oprofen, 12.5 to 75  mg). Ho wever, 
analgesic use for more than 3 days per week can worsen headaches and lead 
to medication-induced headache.TREATMENT  For very severe attacks, dihydroergotamine (1  mg subcutaneously or 0.5 
to 1  mg in travenously [IV]) is usually effective but generally requires an anti -
emetic (e.g., promethazine, 25  mg) bef ore intravenous use. Ketorolac (60  mg 
intramuscularly [IM] or 30  mg IV ), prochlorperazine (10 to 25  mg IM or 10  mg 
IV A6  delivered over a 5-minute period), or metoclopramide (10  mg IV ) A7  is useful 
for patients who are nonresponsive or have contraindications to vasoactive 
abortive agents. An experimental approach is electrical skin stimulation of the upper arms, especially if applied within the first 20 minutes of the onset  
of pain.
 A8 
 PREVENTION
Chronic tension-type headaches may benefit from prophylactic treatment 
with amitriptyline (starting with 10  m g at bedtime and increased slowly up to 
100 m g until the patient improves or intolerable side effects develop), nortrip -
tyline (25 to 100  m g each evening), doxepin (25 to 75  m g/day), maprotiline 
(10 to 25/mg/day), or fluoxetine (10 to 20  m g/day). T ricyclics are gener -
ally more efficacious than serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A17   Muscle relaxants, 
physical therapy, localized botulinum toxin injection, and acupuncture can  
be useful. A18  
 PROGNOSIS
T ension-type headache has a variable prognosis. Adolescents with tension-
type headache and two or more psychiatric factors (e.g., depression and anxiety) 
have a worse prognosis.

CHAPTER  370  Head ac H es and Ot H er Head Pain  2320
 PREVENTION
Medications that are helpful in preventing chronic daily headache include 
tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors if patients are 
depressed, anticonvulsants, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (see 
T ables 370-3 and 370-4). For hemicrania continua, indomethacin (25 to 50  mg 
three times daily) is the preferred treatment.
 PROGNOSIS
The prognosis depends on the underlying headache diagnosis. Depression, 
anxiety, poor sleep, stress, medication overuse, and poor self-efficacy are asso -
ciated with a worse prognosis among patients with chronic headaches. If medication overuse is the cause and the patient is successfully detoxified, about 75% of patients improve when treated with preventive medications. T reatment may fail if the diagnosis is incorrect or because of continued overuse 
of medications, overuse of caffeine, lack of sleep, dietary or other life triggers, 
hormonal factors, or psychiatric factors. Explaining medication overuse head -
ache to the patient, inpatient and outpatient detoxification, and multidisciplinary care treatments have been found helpful. New daily persistent headache often 
does not respond to medical therapy.
 SECONDARY CAUSES OF HEADACHES
 Sinus Headache
Rhinosinusitis (Chapter 398) is characterized by inflammation or infection 
of the nasal mucosa and sinuses. The sinuses themselves are relatively insensate, 
but ducts, turbinates, blood vessels, and ostia are the painful structures.
Headaches attributed to rhinosinusitis are frontal headaches with pain in 
the face, ears, or teeth. The onset of pain is simultaneous with the rhinosinusitis, 
and the headache and face pain resolve within 7 days after successful treat -
ment. The diagnosis requires imaging and clinical evidence that support the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis. Many acute and most chronic headaches that are initially thought to result from sinus disease are found to be migraine or tension-type headache.
The headache should resolve with treatment of acute sinusitis (Chapter 
398). If it does not, an underlying primary headache disorder is likely.
 Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis
T emporal arteritis (Chapter 255) is an inflammatory process seen almost exclusively in elderly individuals. Headache, especially pain in the jaw when 
chewing, is one of the most common features. Its incidence is approximately 
12 per 100,000 and increases with age to 51 per 100,000 in individuals older 
than 80. It affects women more often than men (3 : 1) and is more common 
in white individuals, especially those of Scandinavian and British descent. It is associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.
The headache has no specific feature, but the pain is usually continuous, 
generalized, and occasionally throbbing. The temples are generally painful, and patients complain of pain when performing certain activities of daily living, such as chewing food or combing their hair. T ransient monocular blind -
ness, permanent blindness, and diplopia can occur.
Elevation of the ESR and CRP occurs almost invariably. The diagnosis is 
made by finding giant cells in a temporal artery biopsy specimen. Immediate treatment with corticosteroids, sometimes before the biopsy result is avail -
able, is necessary in doses between 40 and 80 mg daily, with the dose then 
titrated downward while monitoring the ESR or CRP . Used early enough, corticosteroids (Chapter 255) generally prevent the complications of temporal 
arteritis, including blindness. T ocilizumab (162 mg subcutaneously weekly 
or every other week) is FDA approved to provide sustained corticosteroid-free remission in patients with temporal arteritis.
 A21   The disorder can be long  
lasting.
 Intracranial Hypertension and Pseudotumor Cerebri
Intracranial hypertension can be primary and idiopathic or secondary to cere -
bral venous thrombosis (Chapter 379), a mass in the brain (Chapter 180), 
hydrocephalus, or other intracranial processes. Pseudotumor cerebri is an all-
encompassing term referring to increased intracranial pressure without obvious 
mass lesions. Primary idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs in obese women of childbearing age. Secondary pseudotumor cerebri causes a similar 
syndrome but is due to an offending agent such as medications (e.g., tetracy -
cline, minocycline, lithium, fluoroquinolones, vitamin A–related medications, 
growth hormone), endocrine disorders (e.g., parathyroid dysfunction), and sleep apnea. PROGNOSIS
Cluster headache is often a lifelong problem, but remissions may persist for longer periods as the patient ages. The other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias 
are probably lifelong; nevertheless, symptomatic treatment combined with 
preventive medications is helpful.
 CHRONIC DAILY HEADACHE
 DEFINITION
Though not a specific disorder, chronic daily headache, defined as a headache that is present on more than 15 days per month, is challenging for both patients 
and physicians. These headaches may be chronic migraine, chronic tension-
type headache, new daily persistent headache, or chronic cluster headache, with or without overuse of medications.
 EPIDEMIOLOGY
Up to 5% of the population suffers from chronic daily headache, most com -
monly chronic tension-type or chronic migraine. T rigger factors such as a 
previous infection, mild head injury, or stressful life event are present in 40 
to 60% of patients with new daily persistent headache. Risk factors for chronic daily headache include medication overuse, history of migraine headache, frequent headache, depression, female sex, obesity, snoring, stressful life events, 
and low educational level.
 PATHOBIOLOGY
Chronic daily headache is probably related to migraine, with both central and 
peripheral abnormalities. Once migraine has been prolonged and headache 
occurs on a daily basis, allodynia, a sense that a usually nonpainful stimulus 
is becoming painful, often develops. Use of an opiate for more than 8 days per month, especially in men, use of barbiturates for more than 5 days per month, especially in women, or use of triptans for more than 10 to 14 days 
per month can often lead to chronic migraine headache or at least worsening 
of headaches.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
New daily persistent headache is characterized by daily occurrence, onset at specific time, and an unrelenting course. It is generally bilateral, nonpulsating, 
mild to moderate, and associated with features of migraine, photophobia, 
phonophobia, or nausea. Severe nausea or vomiting is rare. New daily persistent headache can be disabling and is difficult to treat. Chronic daily headache is often associated with profound psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression 
and anxiety; such psychiatric comorbidity predicts intractability.
 DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of chronic daily headache is based on the history. It is important 
to identify the underlying type of primary chronic daily headache: chronic 
migraine, chronic tension-type headache, new daily persistent headache, or 
hemicrania continua. Headaches of less than 4 hours’ duration can also be chronic and daily: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hypnic head -
aches occurring every night (usually in the elderly), and episodic stabbing 
headache.
12 It is most important to exclude secondary headaches (including 
post-traumatic headache), headaches associated with vascular disorders (e.g., giant cell arteritis, arteriovenous malformations, carotid and vertebral artery 
dissections), and headaches associated with nonvascular disorders (e.g., intra -
cranial hypertension or hypotension, infections). MRI and laboratory studies (e.g., ESR in an elderly individual) are commonly recommended. Lumbar 
puncture (LP) to assess intracranial pressure may also be indicated in selected  
patients.An imaging procedure such as MRI is indicated for all patients at the onset 
of cluster headaches or other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias because they 
can be the result of infection (Chapters 384 to 386), vascular malformation 
(Chapter 380), carotid dissection, or neoplasm, especially a pituitary tumor 
(Chapter 180). Other possibilities in the differential diagnosis include migraine, hypnic headache (rare short-lasting headaches exclusively during sleep in the elderly), and trigeminal neuralgia.conjunctival injection and occasionally nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis, flushing, and eyelid edema ( T able 370-5). The location of the pain is 
usually behind or above the eye or in the temple but can include the forehead, cheek, teeth, or jaw. The pain reaches its maximum intensity in about 9 minutes and tends to end abruptly. Attacks occur one to eight times a day and are usually described as “boring” or “stabbing” excruciating pain that persists for 
15 minutes to 2 hours. Migraine symptoms may coexist, including unilateral 
photophobia, phonophobia, and rarely, an aura. Unlike migraine patients, who usually try to rest, patients with cluster headaches pace and are unable to sit or lie down. Cluster headaches, often precipitated by alcohol, histamine, or 
nitroglycerin, have a daily periodicity and may also have a seasonal periodic -
ity. For example, episodic cluster headache may occur annually or every 2 
years, often in the same season each time. Chronic cluster headache occurs without a remission.
Paroxysmal hemicrania is pain of short duration, usually 2 to 30 minutes, 
and occurs unilaterally around the eye, temple, or maxillary region, sometimes precipitated by head movements. Autonomic features similar to cluster head -
ache can occur. The usual attack rate is up to 40 episodes each day. Bouts of 
pain may be episodic, separated by a remission, but most patients have daily 
chronic paroxysmal hemicrania without a remission.
Short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and 
tearing attacks are unilateral and consistently on the same side. Although the pain is excruciating, the attack is brief, usually seconds; most patients are free of pain between attacks, although a dull ache can be present. Associated auto -
nomic features include ipsilateral conjunctival injection and tearing.
 DIAGNOSIS
The diagnostic criteria for cluster headache include severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain persisting for 15 to 180 minutes with at least 
one of the following: ipsilateral conjunctival injection or lacrimation, nasal 
congestion or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis with or without ptosis, and restlessness or agitation.
10 Attacks occur between 
once and as often as eight times each day. There is no other cause of the 
disorder.
Paroxysmal hemicrania is defined by unilateral pain persisting for 2 to 30 
minutes, about five times each day, with one or more autonomic features such 
as conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, forehead and facial 
sweating, and miosis or ptosis (or both). Complete prevention may be achieved 
with indomethacin.
Hemicrania continua is a unilateral headache that occurs daily and continu -
ously without pain-free periods; its intensity is moderate, with exacerbations 
of severe pain. During the exacerbations, at least one ipsilateral autonomic 
feature is present: conjunctival redness, lacrimation, nasal congestion, ptosis, or miosis. It responds to indomethacin.
Short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and 
tearing is diagnosed by unilateral orbital, supraorbital, temporal stabbing pain persisting for 5 to 240 seconds at a frequency of three to 200 per day. It is associated with conjunctival injection and tearing.TABLE 370-5  DISTINGUISHING  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRIGEMINAL AUTONOMIC CEPHALALGIAS

Because the course of the headache is brief, oral medications take too long

30 minutes benefits some patients. A19   Sumatriptan or zolmitriptan nasal spray 
or sumatriptan subcutaneously (4 to 6  mg) can be helpful .11 Dihydroergotamine 
can be helpful when given nasally, IM, or even IV. Vagal nerve stimulation was 
recently approved for acute cluster headache. A20   Refractory cases may respond 
to sphenopalatine ganglion and occipital nerve stimulation. Chronic paroxysmal hemicranias and hemicrania continua are characterized by a response to indo -
methacin, 25 to 50  mg thr ee times daily. Short unilateral neuralgiform headache 
with conjunctival injection and tearing attacks is so brief that there are no medications to treat it acutely.TREATMENT  
TREATMENT   PREVENTION
Preventive medications should be started at the beginning of a cluster bout. 
Verapamil, 240 to 480  m g, is the drug of choice. Lithium (300  m g twice daily) 
is an alternative. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, 40  m g/day, or dexametha -
sone, 4  mg twice daily for 2 weeks) act rapidly as a bridge to prevent cluster 
headache while other preventive medications are started. Valproic acid (500 
to 1500  m g/day in divided doses), topiramate (50 to 100  m g/day), melatonin 
(4 m g at bedtime), and gabapentin (300  m g three times daily) are sometimes 
beneficial. Surgical approaches, including suboccipital steroid injections, 
occipital nerve stimulators, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation, hypothalamic 
stimulation, and destructive procedures, are sometimes necessary for this 
disabling headache.
Paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua respond to daily indo -
methacin (25 to 50  m g three times daily). If the patient cannot tolerate indo -
methacin, calcium-channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, 240 to 480  m g/day) or 
melatonin may be helpful. Preventive treatment of short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing includes lamotrigine (100 
to 400  m g/day), topiramate (50 to 100  m g), gabapentin (300 to 900  m g), or 
intravenous lidocaine (starting at 1-2  mg/minute with cardiac monitoring).
Short unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and 
tearing is regarded as a more difficult headache to prevent. Lamotrigine and 
topiramate may be helpful.

is becoming painful, often develops. Use of an opiate for more than 8 days per month, especially in men, use of barbiturates for more than 5 days per month, especially in women, or use of triptans for more than 10 to 14 days 
per month can often lead to chronic migraine headache or at least worsening 
of headaches.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
New daily persistent headache is characterized by daily occurrence, onset at specific time, and an unrelenting course. It is generally bilateral, nonpulsating, 
mild to moderate, and associated with features of migraine, photophobia, 
phonophobia, or nausea. Severe nausea or vomiting is rare. New daily persistent headache can be disabling and is difficult to treat. Chronic daily headache is often associated with profound psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression 
and anxiety; such psychiatric comorbidity predicts intractability.
 DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of chronic daily headache is based on the history. It is important 
to identify the underlying type of primary chronic daily headache: chronic 
migraine, chronic tension-type headache, new daily persistent headache, or 
hemicrania continua. Headaches of less than 4 hours’ duration can also be chronic and daily: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hypnic head -
aches occurring every night (usually in the elderly), and episodic stabbing 
headache.
12 It is most important to exclude secondary headaches (including 
post-traumatic headache), headaches associated with vascular disorders (e.g., giant cell arteritis, arteriovenous malformations, carotid and vertebral artery 
dissections), and headaches associated with nonvascular disorders (e.g., intra -
cranial hypertension or hypotension, infections). MRI and laboratory studies (e.g., ESR in an elderly individual) are commonly recommended. Lumbar 
puncture (LP) to assess intracranial pressure may also be indicated in selected  
patients.
The most common cause of chronic daily headache is overuse of medica -
tions, so patients must be weaned off the overused symptomatic medication.13 
Treatment of underlying depression, anxiety, and pain may also be helpful. 
Occasionally, hospital admission is necessary to break the headache cycle. Acute migraine-specific treatments (see earlier), especially intravenous dihydroergota -
mine (0.5 to 2  mg), are helpful in terminating migrainous attacks.TREATMENT

pain is triggered by mastication, weight loss and inanition may develop; prompt 
treatment is essential.
 Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia
Less common than trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia is unilateral 
pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the ear, 
jaw, throat, and base of the tongue. This neuralgia is rare, with a prevalence 
of less than one per 100,000. The cause is thought to be compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve by blood vessels, tumor, or aneurysm and demyelin -
ation or infection.
The pains are paroxysmal and persist for less than seconds to 2 minutes, 
but patients can experience 30 to 40 attacks in a day. As in trigeminal neuralgia, the pain is triggered by chewing, swallowing, or talking.
The diagnosis is made clinically. MRI should be done to evaluate the glos -
sopharyngeal nerve to exclude a tumor or vascular abnormality. The differential diagnosis includes trigeminal neuralgia, geniculate neuralgia, and atypical pain syndrome.
Pharmacologic therapy is similar to that for trigeminal neuralgia, and carba -
mazepine (200 to 800 mg) is usually the drug of choice. Surgical therapy and 
microvascular decompression or radio frequency ablation should be consid -
ered in patients whose weight loss does not respond promptly to medication. Trigeminal Neuralgia
T rigeminal neuralgia is a distinct, excruciatingly painful condition provoked by sensory stimuli in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.
18 T rigeminal 
neuralgia occurs in four per 100,000 individuals, most commonly in persons 
between 50 and 70 years of age and in women slightly more than in men 
(1.5 : 1).
In younger individuals, multiple sclerosis (Chapter 383) can be associated 
with the condition. In older individuals, an ectatic artery in the vertebrobasilar system often causes the syndrome. The trigeminal nerve root entry zone is 
thought to be the site of pathology. Either demyelination or compression of this region increases the firing of trigeminal afferents. When a specific cause can be defined, the term symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia  is often used.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
T rigeminal neuralgia pain is characteristically sharp, lancinating (shooting), and electric shock–like in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve: cheek (V2), 
chin or lower teeth (V3), and around the eye (V1). A combination of V2 and 
V3 is the most common. The paroxysms are brief—usually seconds but up to 2 minutes. Some patients have a dull and continuous interictal pain, whereas most have only staccato-like volleys of pain. Pain is usually triggered by stimuli 
such as touching the face, brushing the teeth, air moving across the face, or 
masticating food. Once a volley of pain is triggered, there is usually a refrac -
tory period in which pain will not occur.
 DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic criteria include paroxysmal attacks of pain persisting for a second to 2 minutes and affecting one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. T o 
make the diagnosis, the pain must be intensely sharp, stabbing, or precipitated 
by a trigger. Each attack is stereotypical, and there are usually no other neu -
rologic defects. Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia by definition has no causative lesion, whereas symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has a cause such as vascular 
compression of the trigeminal nerve root exit zone. The differential diagnosis 
includes trigeminal autonomic cephalgia, which has autonomic accompani -
ments that are not associated with trigeminal neuralgia. Atypical facial pain, idiopathic stabbing headache, and T olosa-Hunt syndrome, an inflammatory 
syndrome of the anterior cavernous sinus, are also included in the differential. 
MRI is recommended to evaluate possible secondary causes of trigeminal neuralgia, such as demyelination, tumors, and vascular loops on the trigeminal nerve exit zone.Intracranial hypotension was once considered rare, but modern imaging 
techniques suggest an incidence of about five per 100,000 per year; it is slightly 
more common in women than men. The onset is usually at about 40 years of 
age, but it can occur in children and the elderly. Post-LP headaches occur more commonly but only infrequently persist.
 PATHOBIOLOGY
The cause of primary intracranial hypotension is thought to be a small leak or tear in the dura, usually in the lumbar region around cystic structures called 
T arlov cysts. The cause of intracranial hypotension may not be the tear itself 
but rather the low CSF volume and low epidural venous pressure that assists in development of the lower pressure and hence the leak. The leaks frequently occur in the thoracic and cervicothoracic junction spine. Previous trauma 
history is reported in only one third of cases. Genetic and connective tissue 
disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome [Chapter 244]) may predispose individuals to have these leaks.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Intracranial hypotension is characterized clinically by a positional headache. The location of the pain is variable, and the most constant characteristic is 
the orthostatic change in the pain. If the leak is untreated for a long time, the 
headache may lose the orthostatic characteristic. Posterior neck pain can also occur. Changes in hearing, taste, and balance, as well as blurred vision and diplopia, can develop if hindbrain herniation occurs. If very severe hindbrain 
herniation occurs, changes in consciousness, subdural hygromas, ataxia, a 
pseudo-frontotemporal dementia can occur.
 DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of intracranial hypotension is made by MRI showing pachy -
meningeal enhancement, venous engorgement, dural thickening, pituitary 
fossa enlargement, and herniation of the hindbrain ( Fig. 370-1). Hindbrain 
herniation appears as a downward descent of the posterior fossa along with 
loss of the prechiasmatic cistern, flattening of the pons against the clivus, and descent of the cerebellar tonsils, which is often misconstrued as a Chiari I 
malformation. LP may also show low ( <
50 mm H 2O) CSF pressure, but it 
also may be normal. The diagnosis is most commonly made by clinical char -
acteristics and imaging, so the decision as to whether or not to do an LP 
should be made on a case-by-case basis because there is at least a theoretical risk of more hindbrain herniation. The differential diagnosis includes new daily persistent headache, chronic migraine, or another secondary headache. 
The diagnosis is confirmed if a CSF leak is demonstrated by isotope studies, 
CT myelography, or MR myelography.Idiopathic increased intracranial pressure occurs in one to two per 100,000 
individuals but in 19 to 20 per 100,000 individuals (15 to 55 years of age) 
who are obese. Women are affected more frequently than men (6 to 8  :  1). 
Onset is usually in young adulthood.
The cause of the increased pressure is poor CSF absorption, as is thought 
to be the problem in idiopathic intracranial hypertension; venous hyperten -
sion, as is seen in venous thrombosis; or a mass that causes an increase in pressure. A genetic component is also likely because there are reports of the condition occurring in families.
 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by headache in more than 90% of individuals, about 90% of whom are obese. The headache may 
be pulsatile and is frequently felt behind the eyes. Patients often report neck 
pain, upper back pain, or even radicular pain. The intensity of headache does not correlate with the height of the intracranial pressure. Pulse-synchronous tinnitus is a frequent accompaniment, as are transient visual obscurations and 
diplopia. Vision-specific quality of life is often reduced.
On examination, papilledema (Chapter 395, Fig. 395-25) may be found. 
The remainder of the general and neurologic examination is usually normal 
in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, but abnormalities on 
examination may point to a secondary cause, such as underlying venous sinus 
thrombosis (Chapter 379), ischemic stroke, central nervous system infection (Chapters 384 and 385), or brain tumor (Chapter 180). Although idiopathic intracranial hypertension often persists for years, the condition can be self-
limited. In about a third of patients, there are permanent visual sequelae related 
to the effect of papilledema.
 DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of intracranial pressure is made by the symptoms and signs such as papilledema (Chapter 395, Fig. 395-25), but up to 40% of cases of 
presumptive intracranial hypertension are not confirmed by specialist evalu-
ation, usually because of an initially inaccurate diagnosis of papilledema.
14 
MRI is necessary to exclude secondary causes of increased intracranial pres -
sure. MR or CT venography is often needed to exclude venous sinus thrombosis (Chapter 379). LP must be performed unless patients have a contraindication such as an intracranial mass lesion, and CSF pressure should be measured. The diagnosis can be made if the pressure is elevated (CSF >
250  mm H 2O) 
and the fluid itself is normal in terms of its protein level, glucose level, and 
cell count. Visual fields must be examined formally because visual acuity is 
not affected until late in the course of the disorder.

FIGURE  3 70-1.  Intracranial hypotension.  this 56- year-old woman had headaches that 
initially were positional. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging shows char -
acteristic findings of engorgement of the pituitary (*), slumping of the posterior fossa 
with tonsillar herniation ( large arrow), and meningeal enhancement ( smaller arrows). TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS  
TREATMENT  Acetazolamide (doses ranging from 500 to 4000  mg daily) c ombined 
with a weight loss program is more efficacious for individuals with idio -
pathic intracranial hypertension and mild to moderate visual loss than is  
placebo. A22  , A23   Any underlying secondary cause should also be treated (e.g., 
stopping an offending medication, treatment of sleep apnea [Chapter 377]). 
Weight loss is beneficial in obese subjects. If visual loss progresses, surgical procedures should be considered. Optic nerve sheath fenestration allows CSF to escape through slits or windows in the orbit; sometimes the treatment of one side decreases the optic disc swelling on the other side as well. Complica -
tions include visual loss or diplopia, so visual fields must be followed carefully to anticipate and prevent visual loss. Lumbar or ventricular peritoneal diversion procedures also reduce intracranial pressure, but their complications include infection and shunt obstruction. Venous sinus stenting has occasionally been used for fixed stenoses.
15TREATMENT  
 PROGNOSIS
The prognosis of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is good 
with treatment, but up to a third of inadequately treated patients can experi -
ence permanent defects of visual fields or loss of visual acuity. Individuals are susceptible to recurrence if they suddenly gain weight.
 Intracranial Hypotension
Intracranial hypotension (or CSF hypovolemia) causes a headache that is characteristically better when the patient is supine and worse when the patient 
is upright. It can be primary (spontaneous) or secondary to another underly -
ing cause, most commonly a previous LP . PROGNOSIS
Patients with trigeminal neuralgia can have spontaneous or medication-induced 
remissions. Microvascular decompression is often curative. In patients whose  Grade A References

MRI is recommended to evaluate possible secondary causes of trigeminal neuralgia, such as demyelination, tumors, and vascular loops on the trigeminal nerve exit zone.For spontaneous intracranial hypotension, the recommended treatment is 
bed rest and an epidural blood patch (blind or directed).16 Treatment of CSF 
leaks includes bed rest, caffeine (200 to 300  mg t wo to three times daily), an 
abdominal binder wrapped around the abdomen to increase central pressure, 
and generous intake of oral fluids. For post–dural puncture headache and most spontaneous episodes, an epidural blood patch usually improves the symptoms within days.
17 Surgical repair is rarely required. With treatment, the symptoms 
and MRI findings should resolve completely. Recurrence is infrequent.TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS  
Trigeminal neuralgia is treated with medications or surgery.19 Carbamazepine 
(400 to 1200  mg) is c onsidered the first-line agent for the neuralgia. Phenytoin 
(200 to 300  mg), baclof en (40 to 80  mg), clonaz epam (2 to 6  mg), v alproic acid 
(500 to 1500  mg), lamotr igine (100 to 400  mg), gabapen tin (900 to 1800  mg), 
oxcarbazepine (300 to 1800  mg), levetiracetam 2 to 4  g), and topiramate (50 
to 200  mg) ar e also used. Botulinum toxin may be effective for this disorder. 
Surgical treatments include microvascular decompression, which may alleviate the symptoms and preserve sensory function. Other treatments include partial destruction of the trigeminal nerve with heat (radio frequency lesions) or with glycerol (chemical destruction).TREATMENT  
 PROGNOSIS

remissions. Microvascular decompression is often curative. In patients whose  G rade A References

CHAPTER  370  HeadacHes and OtHer Head Pain  2323.e2
3. A 30-year-old woman has increasingly frequent headaches characterized 
by bilateral holocranial headache, photophobia, nausea, and rare vomiting. 
The headaches occur 25 days each month, and she is now using an acet -
aminophen/butalbital combination medication almost daily. The most 
likely diagnosis is:
 A. Chronic migraine
 B. Chronic migraine with medication overuse
 C. Chronic tension-type headache
 D. Chronic tension-type headache with medication overuse
Answer:  B The most likely diagnosis is chronic migraine with medication 
overuse, because she has a headache more than 15 days per month and uses 
a butalbital-containing medication more than 3 days in a week. The headache 
may revert to episodic or chronic migraine when she reduces this daily acute 
rescue treatment. The headache is associated with nausea and rare vomiting, 
so it is not a tension-type headache.
4. A 30-year-old woman presents with chronic daily headache, pulsatile tin -
nitus, and episodic blurring of her vision. On examination she has papil -
ledema. What evaluation would you perform?
 A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture (LP)
 B. MRI, LP , and visual fields
 C. Computed tomography (CT)
 D. LP alone
 E. None of the above
Answer:  B The MRI is required to look for any mass lesions and can often 
show venous sinus thrombosis. The LP must be done to not only be sure that 
the opening pressure is elevated but also that the cerebrospinal fluid itself is 
normal. Visual fields must be performed and monitored to prevent blindness; 
visual acuity testing alone is insufficient. CT scans are good for excluding 
mass lesions but are not adequate alone. LP alone without imaging is contra -
indicated. LP also may be contraindicated if the patient has an associated 
significant Chiari I malformation.REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. A 30-year-old man presents with frequent bilateral, squeezing pain that 
causes photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. The headaches worsen 
with activity. They occur four times monthly and last 24 to 48 hours. The 
most likely diagnosis is:
 A. Migraine
 B. T ension-type headache
 C. Hemicrania continua
 D. Atypical facial pain
Answer:  A The most likely diagnosis is migraine. Although migraine is more 
frequent in women, men also can have migraines. If a headache is associated 
with both photophobia/phonophobia and nausea, the diagnosis cannot be 
tension-type headache. Hemicrania continua is usually unilateral, and although 
it can last for longer periods of time, it may have autonomic symptoms. Atypi -
cal facial pain is really not a diagnosis in this case because there are migrainous 
features.
2. A 35-year-old woman presents with a unilateral headache over her right 
eye. She has associated tearing and redness of the eye with the pain. The 
headaches last 40 minutes and occur daily, usually in the evening. The 
correct diagnosis is:
 A. Paroxysmal hemicrania
 B. Cluster headache
 C. Hemicrania continua
 D. Acute glaucoma
Answer:  B She has unilateral brief pain with two autonomic features that are 
diagnostic of cluster headaches. Although men are more likely to have cluster 
headache, women suffer from this type of headache as well. Paroxysmal hemi -
crania would be more brief, usually lasting less than 30 minutes. Hemicrania 
continua is longer lasting, and acute glaucoma would not be intermittent or 
occur only at a specific time.
