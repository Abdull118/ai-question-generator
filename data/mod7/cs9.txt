NOTE: 
This lecture is meant to be an overview and not a 
detailed trauma lecture. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
A traumatically induced structural injury 
and/or physiological disruption of brain 
function as a result of an external force that 
is indicated by new onset or worsening of at 
least one of the following clinical signs 
immediately following the event:
Any period of loss or a decreased level of 
consciousness
Any loss of memory for events immediately 
before or after the injury
Any alteration in mental state at the time of 
the injury
Neurological deficits that may not be transient
Intracranial injuryPathophysiology
Primary Brain Injury
Occurs at the time of trauma
Mechanisms:
External mechanical forces transferred to intracranial contents:
Head being struck by an object
Head striking an object
Acceleration/deceleration brain injury without direct trauma 
to the head/brain
Forces generated by an explosion
Foreign body penetrating the brain
Intracranial bleed
Pathology seen:
Focal contusions & hematomas
Shearing of white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury) along 
with cerebral edema & swelling
Pathophysiology
Secondary Brain Injury
Cascade of molecular injury mechanisms that are initiated at 
the time of initial trauma & continues for hours or days
Mechanisms:
Events post injury that cause neuronal cell death, cerebral 
edema & increased intracranial pressure:
•Neurotransmitter-mediated excitotoxicity causing 
glutamate, free-radical injury to cell membranes
•Electrolyte imbalances
•Mitochondrial dysfunction
•Inflammatory responses
•Apoptosis
•Secondary ischemia from vasospasm, focal microvascular 
occlusion, vascular injury
Goal is to prevent secondary brain insults like:
Hypotension & hypoxia(↓oxygen & glucose)
Fever & seizures(↑metabolic demand)
Hyperglycemia

Closed Penetrating (Open)
•An injury of the brain caused 
by movement of the brain 
within the skull
Etiology: 
•Falls, MVA, being struck with 
or by an object, blast injury
•Acceleration-deceleration 
brain injury without direct 
trauma to the head/brain
•Intracranial bleed•Injury to the brain caused by 
a foreign object entering the 
skull
Etiology: 
•Firearms injury, being struck 
by a sharp object
Clinical Evaluation
Remember this is not a detailed trauma 
lecture but there are things you should be 
aware of …What is consciousness?
“State of wakefulness and awareness of self 
and surroundings”
•Neural processes that allow patients to:
•Perceive
•Comprehend
•Act on internal and external environment
•Neurophysiologic functions:
Arousal
Degree to which a patient can interact with the 
environment
Awareness
Depth and content of the arousalAltered Mental Status
“A change in the level of consciousness”
•Can be caused by a TBI but if none, 
think of other etiologies like:
•Infection (meningitis, encephalitis, brain 
abscess, sepsis, etc.)
•Tumors
•Vasculitides
•Medications
•Toxins 
•Metabolic (glucose, thyroid, etc.)
ALWAYS GET A GOOD HISTORY!!Levels of Arousal
Alert •Fully conscious
Lethargic •Appears somnolent
•May be able to maintain arousal 
spontaneously or with repeated 
light stimulation
Obtunded •Requires pain or loud voice to 
arouse
Stuporous •Unresponsiveness from which the 
individual can be aroused only by 
vigorous & repeated stimulus
Comatose “Unarousable unresponsiveness” 
•Unresponsive individual lies with 
eyes closed, lacking awareness of 
self & environment
Signs &Symptoms of TBI
Changes in pupils Altered Mental Status:
Altered orientation
Alteration in personality
AmnesiaVomiting
Headaches
Motor issues/paralysis
Symptoms seen with increased 
ICP:
Cushing’s Reflex
(Increased BP, Bradycardia, Irregular Breathing)
PosturingHearing & speech issues
Balance & gait issuesAll depends on what part of the brain is affected and 
what side of the brain is affected.
Cognitive, Physical, & Emotional symptoms are seen.

Glasgow Coma Score
A clinical tool designed to assess coma & 
impaired consciousness
Most used severity scoring systems 
•GCS scores of 3 to 8 = severe TBI
•GCS scores of 9 to 12 = moderate TBI
•GCS scores of 13 to 15 = mild TBI
•NOTE: 3 is the lowest score obtainable
Neuroimaging scales you might see..
The Marshall scale:
•CT findings to classify injuries in six different 
categories
•It is widely used in neurotrauma centers and 
has been shown to predict the risk of 
increased intracranial pressure and outcome 
in adults accurately, but lacks reproducibility 
in patients with multiple types of brain 
injury
The Rotterdam scale:
•More recent CT-based classification 
developed to overcome the limitations of 
the Marshall scale & it has shown 
promising early results but requires 
broader validation

Diagnosis:
•Clinical Signs & Symptoms
•Graded symptom check lists & 
neurocognitive assessments
•Follow neuroimaging protocols as not all 
patient need images!
•Only performed when there are concerns for skull fracture, 
intracranial hemorrhage, or other intracranial pathology based 
on physical exam
Individualize Treatment!
•Physical & cognitive rest for the first 24-48 
hours then a graded program of exertion prior 
to medical clearance and return to 
sports/work.   
•Gradual return to school and social activities 
(prior to contact sports) in a manner that does 
not result in a significant exacerbation of 
symptoms.Catastrophic Brain 
InjuriesDiffuse Axonal Injury(DAI)
•Caused by shearing 
mechanisms
•Visualized as multiple small 
lesions in white matter 
tracts
•Typically seen in gray-white 
junction of hemispheres
•Severe injury affect corpus 
callosum and/or midbrain
•Patient’s present with 
profound coma with 
NORMAL intracranial 
pressure
•Poor prognosis
Cerebral Contusion
•Most frequently 
encountered lesions
•“Brain Bruise”
•Commonly seen in the base, 
frontal & temporal areas
•Severe cases may lead to an 
intraparenchymal hematoma
•Occur because of 
acceleration/deceleration 
injuries(Coup-Contrecoup)
•Symptoms variable 
depending on size of lesions 
& the associated swelling
•Rapid swelling = rapid 
decline
•Can lead to death even after 
what appears to be minor 
trauma!
Extra-axial Hematomas
Blood collection 
outside of the 
substance of the brain:
1.Epidural
2.Subdural
3.Subarachnoid 
hemorrhage
4.Intracerebral 
Hemorrhage
All the above can also be 
categorized as 
hemorrhagic stroke 
syndromes!
Extradural=EpiduralEpidural
•Torn dural vessels 
•e.g., MMA
•Almost always associated 
with skull fracture!
•Tend NOT to be 
associated with brain 
damage but rapid 
bleeding causes 
compression & herniation 
towards foramen 
magnum
•Symptoms:
•Initial LOC followed by 
“lucid interval”
•Ipsilateral dilated fixed 
pupils & signs of increased 
ICP common
Subdural
•Damage to bridging vessels 
(venous) or blossoming of 
superficial cortical contusions
•Most common “SLOW BLEED” 
(chronic)
•Signs &symptoms progress over 
days
•Loss of consciousness (LOC) 
fluctuates 
•Symptoms include headache & 
focal neurologic signs
•Alcoholics, elderly & persons on 
blood thinners at high risk
•Crescent shaped appearance on 
CT scan
•Can occur acutely:
•Due to high velocity head injury
•Most lethal
•can behave like epidural 
hemorrhage
•Progressive neurological decline l
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
•Commonly caused by ruptured saccular 
(berry) aneurysms in circle of Willis
•Non-aneurysmal SAH (e.g., trauma, 
tumors, amyloid) caused by disruption 
of pial vessels
•Common in Sylvain fissures & 
interpeduncular cisterns
•Extension from adjacent bleed
•Symptoms:
•Sudden, intense headache
•“Worst headache of my life”
•“Thunderclap”
•Nausea, vomiting
•Meningismus (neck pain/stiffness)
•Elevated pressure outside the brain 
may cause rapid loss of consciousness 
or death
•Diagnosis:
•CT may be normal!!
•Lumbar puncture needed to check for 
blood in CSF
  
Intracerebral 
Hemorrhage
Focal collection of blood within 
brain parenchyma or ventricular 
system not due to trauma
Does not include subdural or 
epidural hemorrhage 
•Intra-parenchymal
•Includes parenchymal 
hemorrhage after CNS infarction
•Intra-ventricular
•From arterio-venous 
malformations 
•Symptoms depend upon 
region of brain involved
•Headaches & vomiting common
•Alteration of consciousness 
common
CBI : Treatment
•Early diagnosis is key to survivability!
•Time is critical
•Need to: 
•Do primary assessment (ABCDE)
•Rule out intracranial hemorrhage
•Non contrast CT of head imaging of choice
•Monitor for progressing edema
•Increased ICP
•Cerebral Hypoxia
•Seizure prophylaxis
Slide adapted from Dr. Carcione, Spring 2014 lectureMay lead to permanent 
damage; herniation & deathCBI : Treatment
Epidural •Surgical decompression
Subdural •Acute: Urgent surgical 
decompression
•Chronic: Monitor symptoms as 
most go unrecognized; may 
need surgery
Subarachnoid 
Hemorrhage•Endovascular coils or surgical 
clipping of the saccular 
aneurysm
•Nimodipine to decrease stroke 
risk
•Ventriculoperitoneal shunt if 
hydrocephalus occurs
Intracerebral •Intraventricular:  shunt if 
increased intracranial pressure
•Intraparenchymal:  surgical 
decompression
Endovascular coils
Surgical clipping

(150mmH₂0) in 
adults
•Lower in 
children < 12 
mmHg 
(120mmH₂O)
Abnormal ICP >

General Management of Elevated ICP
ABCD’s of resuscitation
Careful intubation
Head elevation (30°)
Hyperventilation
PaCO₂ 26-30mmHg
Immediate benefit in ICP
Used for <24 hours
IV Mannitol vs 
Hypertonic saline
ICP monitoring (Key)
Treat underlying cause!
Complications of Elevated ICP
Upper Brainstem 
CompressionMiddle Brainstem 
CompressionLower Brainstem Injury
•Increasing blood 
pressure
•Reflex bradycardia (vagus 
nerve stimulation)
•Cheyne-Stokes 
respirations
•Pupils become small & 
reactive
•Decorticate posturing•Widening pulse 
pressure
•Increasing bradycardia
•CNS Hyperventilation 
(deep & rapid)
•Bilateral pupil 
sluggishness or 
inactivity
•Decerebrate posturing•Pupils dilated & 
unreactive
•Cluster respirations 
(erratic with no pattern)
•Irregular & erratic pulse 
rate
•ECG Changes
•Hypotension
•Loss of response to 
painful stimuli
Slide adapted from Dr. Carcione, Spring 2014 lecture
Herniation Syndromes
•Damage to neural or 
vascular structure
•Can occur via traction 
or compression
•Occurs when there is 
pressure difference 
between the 
intracranial 
compartments
•Brain parenchyma 80%
•CSF 10 %
•Blood 10%
Cerebral Herniation Syndromes
aSubfalcian
(cingulate)•Occurs when increased pressure in one 
hemisphere displaces brain tissue under the falx 
cerebri
•Can cause compression of the anterior cerebral 
artery & extensive infarction of the frontal & 
parietal lobesSymptoms include 
contralateral leg 
weakness
bUncal
(transtentorial)•The uncus of the temporal lobe displaced over the 
free edge of the tentorium
•Compression of CN3 with pupillary dilation on the 
same side
•Duret hemorrhage within the central pons  & 
midbrain in advanced stagesSymptoms include 
ipsilateral dilated pupil 
& contralateral 
hemiparesis
cCentral
(transtentorial)•Midline, downward displacement of cerebral 
tissue
•Compression of CN3, upper brainstem, & cerebral 
peduncles
•Distortion or traction of the superior portion of the 
basilar artery & the posterior cerebral arteries, 
leading to occipital lobe infarctionSymptoms depend 
upon the progression of 
deterioration from 
rostral to caudal 
structures
dExtracranial
(calvarial)•Due to space occupying lesions or blood that is 
accumulating outside of the brainSymptoms depend 
upon the amount of 
blood & the direction of 
the displacement 
eCerebellar 
tonsillar•Displacement of cerebellar tonsils through the 
foramen magnumCompression of the 
medulla leads to 
cardiopulmonary arrest
Summary CBI
•Coma is altered consciousness with loss 
of arousal & awareness
•Evaluation
•History & physical exam including:
•pupils, respiratory pattern, stimuli & response
•Determine the etiology
•Structural/Intrinsic (Trauma? Tumor? Bleed?)
•Toxic/Metabolic
•Infectious
•Stabilization
•ABC’s
•Decide about increased ICP & treat 
accordinglySKULL Fractures

Skull Fractures
•Linear skull fracture
•Occur most frequently in the parietal bone but 
can occur in any bone of the calvarium
•Complications 
•Most linear skull fractures heal without 
complication
•Rare complications include formation of 
subgaleal or epidural hematoma
•Depressed skull fracture
•Bony defects or "step-offs" may be palpable
•The risks of dural tear and brain laceration 
increase with the depth of the depression
•In addition to intracranial hemorrhage, 
complications of depressed skull fractures 
include:
•compression of underlying brain parenchyma
•intraparenchymal bone fragments
•cosmetic deformity
Basilar Skull Fracture
Involves at least 1 of 
the 5 bones that 
comprise the base of 
the skull 
1.Ethmoid 
(cribriform plate)
2.Frontal bone 
(orbital plate)
3.Temporal bone 
(petrous & 
squamous 
portion)
4.Sphenoid
5.Occipital bones
Signs & Symptoms of Basilar Skull Fractures 
Battle sign •Subcutaneous bleeding over the mastoid 
process 
Raccoon eyes •Subcutaneous bleeding around the orbit 
Hemotympanum •Blood behind the tympanic membrane 
CSF rhinorrhea •Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the nose 
CSF otorrhea •Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the ear 
Cranial nerve deficits •Facial paralysis, anosmia, nausea, vomiting, 
vertigo, nystagmus, tinnitus, or hearing loss
“Raccoon eyes”Complications of Basilar Skull Fractures
•Hearing loss
•Cranial nerve impairment
•CSF leakage:
•Clear Rhinorrhea or 
otorrhea is found in up 
to 20% of temporal 
bone fractures
•Can occur immediately 
or several days after 
trauma
•“Halo” sign
•Clear drainage that 
separates from bloody 
drainage suggests the 
presence of CSF
Skull Fractures: Treatment
1.Linear
•Observation & monitoring
•Assess for worsening of 
symptoms
2.Depressed
•Tetanus immunization
•Antibiotics
•Anti-seizure medications
•Neurosurgical consultation
3.Basilar
•Intracranial hemorrhages 
are surgical emergencies
•Neurosurgical consultation
