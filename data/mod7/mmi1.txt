E.NK cell deficiency patientPathogenesis
1. Colonize (e.g. nasopharynx) and attach to 
mucosal cells
2. Colonize the upper respiratory tract
- Impair ciliary function
- Cell Wall components (e.g. LPS, pili)
- viral infection
- smoking
3. Immune evasion, enter circulation
- IgA protease
- Evade complement system
4. Cross blood brain barrier to enter CSF
Mace SE  2008.  Emerg Med Clin N Am 38:281Pathogenesis
5. Enter CSF and proliferate
- poor defense mechanisms
6. Trigger inflammatory response
- Leukocyte infiltration
 - Oxidative stresses
- Immunopathology
7. Inflammatory process can extend 
throughout the subarachnoid space 
about the brain and spinal cord

•Gram negative, pleomorphic rod 
(coccobacilli/short)
•Respiratory transmission
•Virulence factors
•IgA protease, pili
•Polysaccharide Capsule (type b)
•Major virulence factor
•Contains polyribitol phosphate (PRP) – 
vaccine elicits immunity using this antigen
•Initial presentation may be a 1-3 day 
history of mild respiratory illness or 
otitis media
•Followed by symptoms of meningitisPathogenesis•The severity of systemic 
disease is related to the rate 
of clearance of bacteria from 
the blood
Important checkpoint 
for immune response
- Specific antibodies 
directed against the 
capsule are needed to 
stimulate phagocytosis 
and complement 
mediated responses
What if there is no 
specific antibody to this 
particular bacteria?H. influenzae will disseminate through the 
blood to the meningesVaccine elicits antibody 
production so that if you 
are infected, you should 
have serum IgGPathogenesis

H. influenzae Type B Diagnosis and Treatment
•DIAGNOSIS
•Blood and CSF collected 
•Microscopy- Gram negative rods 
can be detected well in CSF 
•Chocolate agar (requires factors 
X&V- fastidious)
•TREATMENT
•3rd generation cephalosporins
•Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone
•Conjugate vaccine
Meningococcal meningitis: Neisseria 
meningitidis
•Gram negative, aerobic, diplococci
•Virulence factors 
•IgA protease, pili
•polysaccharide capsule 
•Endotoxin (Lipid A)- Lipooligosaccharide 
(LOS)
•Bacteria are carried asymptomatically 
•Transmitted by respiratory droplets, 
saliva
•among people in prolonged contact, such as 
family members living together, military 
barracks, college dormitories
•Outbreaks most frequently in late winter 
and early spring ; carrier rate is increased
•Different rates based on serotypes
•A, B, C, Y , WPathogenesis
•Meningococci are internalized 
into phagocytic vacuoles and 
are able to avoid intracellular 
death, replicate, and then 
migrate to subepithelial spaces
•LOS endotoxin is largely 
attributed to the diffuse 
vascular damage associated 
with meningitisNeisseria meningitidis Clinical Features
•Incubation period of 1-3 days
•May be a few days of upper respiratory 
symptoms
•Acute onset (6-24hrs) with sore throat, 
drowsiness, stiff neck, fever, 
photophobia
•Often presence of petechial, purpuric, 
and or ecchymotic rash
•The skin rash may advance from a few ill-
defined lesions to a widespread petechial 
eruption within a few hours.
•Septicemia with or without meningitis is 
a life-threatening disease
•Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome- 
overwhelming disseminated intravascular 
coagulation with shock, together with 
bleeding into brain and adrenal glandsNeisseria meningitidis Diagnosis & Treatment
•DIAGNOSIS
•CSF sample for:
•Gram stain
•Culture: Isolation of , gram negative 
diplococci that grown on chocolate agar, 
Thayer-Martin agar
•IF UNTREATED = fatal

•Bacteria can be acquired as a nosocomial 
infections, or from infected mother (birth 
canal during delivery, especially following 
obstetric complications)
•Mother may be infected or colonized but have 
no symptoms
•Otitis media is a common predisposing factor
