1.Hematogenous
•Penetration:
• of respiratory epithelium (e.g., 
meningococci)
•Bite of arthropod (e.g., West Nile virus)
•Bite of mammal (e.g., Rabies)
•Transplacentally (e.g., Rubella)
•Enter CNS where blood-brain barrier is 
less restrictive
•Choroid plexus → CSF → Brain tissue
•Enter CNS across endothelial cells
2.   Neural pathways
•Travel inside nerves (e.g. rabies, HSV, 
VZV)
3.  Direct 
•Trauma Aseptic Meningitis
•Viruses are the most common 
cause
•Occurrence of signs, symptoms, 
and CSF profile suggesting 
meningitis in the absence of 
typical bacterial pathogens
•Identifies that the CSF from 
patients with this syndrome is 
sterile on routine 
bacteriological culture
•Caused by agents that do not grow 
under standard microbiological 
conditions (e.g., fungi, autoimmunehttp://
www.meningitis.org/Encephalitis
•Most cases of encephalitis are 
caused by viral infections
•General features of encephalitis
•Acute onset of febrile illness 
accompanied by  headache, altered 
mental status
•Disorientation, hallucination, 
behavioral disturbances
•Altered mental status with focal or 
diffuse neurologic signs helps 
distinguish encephalitis from 
meningitisLocation of infection & Clinical manifestations

Togavirus
–WEE, EEE, VEE
–Chikingunya
Reovirus
–CO Tick fever
Bunyavirus
–Hantavirus
–CCHFVHerpes Simplex Virus
•Enveloped, dsDNA linear; 
transcription in nucleus
•Encode a viral DNA polymerase- 
target for antiviral drugs
•2 types:  HSV-1 & HSV-2
•Replicate in mucoepithelial cells 
and neurons
•Establish latent infections in cell 
body of dorsal root ganglionHSV Epidemiology and Transmission
•HSV encephalitis (HSE) is a common form of 
severe sporadic acute focal encephalitis in 
the United States (10% of cases)
•HSV-1 most common cause
•HSV-2 more typically produces aseptic 
meningitis but may cause encephalitis in 
neonates 
•HSV is transmitted in secretions and by close 
contact; vesicle fluid, saliva, and vaginal 
secretions
•HSV-2 (neonate encephalitis) can be acquired in 
utero but more commonly is contracted either 
during passage of the infant through the vaginal 
canal because the mother is shedding virus at 
delivery
•Persons with inadequate cell-mediated 
immunity are at risk for developing severe 
disseminated HSV infectionsHSV Pathogenesis
•Result of 
1)Reactivation (latency- sensory 
ganglion cells)
2)Primary infection (children & 
young adults)
•In HSE, the virus is present and 
replicating within neurons
•Infection is cytolytic
•Inflammation with infiltrate of 
mononuclear cells
•Necrosis
•Necrotic brain tissue allows the 
disease to spreadHSV Encephalitis Disease
•Usually caused by HSV-1; pathology and 
immunopathology cause the destruction of 
the temporal lobe and give rise to RBCs in 
CSF, seizures, focal neurologic abnormalities, 
and other characteristics of viral encephalitis
•HSV-2 is often associated with meningitis as 
a complication of genital infection
NEONATES
•Most commonly associated with HSV-2 
infection
•Baby initially appears septic and vesicular 
lesion may be present
•HSV can disseminate to other organs; 
underdeveloped cell –mediated immunity
•Progression can lead to death, mental 
retardation or neurologic disability, even 
with treatmentHSV Diagnosis and Treatment
•The diagnosis can be facilitated by 
finding frontal or temporal lobe 
abnormalities using CT and MRI
•CSF 
•Similar to those 
found in viral meningitis
•Pleocytosis (mostly lymphs)
•Presence of RBCs
•Almost normal glucose
•PCR of CSF
•Acyclovir
•Intravenous
•ASAPArboviruses
•Enveloped, (+) ssRNA viruses
•Family- Flaviviruses

Encephalitis, YF, DENV, Zika

–Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), EEE, 
VEE, Chikungunya

Arbovirus Transmission Cycle Examples
Generalized Pathophysiology
•Local infection at bite site
•Primary viremia can be 
associated w/ mild systemic 
symptoms
•Most infections stop here
•Rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, 
myalgia, fever
•If high virus levels, escapes 
immune response  and reaches 
other tissues w/ severe 
symptoms
Virus enters CNS via 
infection of small vessel 
endothelial cells in 
brain or choroid plexusClinical Presentation
•Rash, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, 
conjunctivitis
•Some associated w/ severe disease 
in the elderly (St. Louis 
encephalitis, WNV)
•WEE, EEE similar presentation
•VEE in Central, S. America, horses
•Zika increasing linkage to 
congenital disease in CNS
•Spontaneous abortion, microcephaly, 
intrauterine growth restriction, 
Guillain-BarreArbovirus Diagnosis and Treatment
•Often empiric, travel status 
crucial, outdoor activities
•Blood and CSF samples
•IgM or IgG tests, RT-PCR available 
depending on the suspected 
etiology
•Histopathology in fatal cases
•No specific treatments available
•Prophylaxis
•Vaccines for some (EEE, WEE, 
Japanese encephalitis, YF)
•Vector controlRabies Virus
•Rhabdovirus family
•(-) ssRNA, enveloped, bullet 
shaped particle
•Worldwide distribution, 
zoonotic
Rabies Pathogenesis
•Retrograde travel to dorsal root 
ganglia and spinal cord, rapid 
ascent
•Infection of brain, neuron 
degeneration
•Little pathology except Negri 
bodies (variable)
•Afferent neurons traffic virus to 
highly innervated sites

Adapted from Murray et.al: Medical Microbiology, 6 th Edition, 2009Rabies Diagnosis and Treatment
•Evidence of infection and/or history of 
potential exposure , including symptoms and 
the detection of antibody, does not occur 
until it is to late for intervention
•Samples
•Saliva, serum, CSF, and skin biopsies of hair 
follicles of the neck
•Tests
•Saliva can be tested by virus isolation or reverse 
transcription followed by polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR). 
•Serum and spinal fluid are tested for antibodies 
to rabies virus.
•Skin biopsy specimens are examined for rabies 
antigen in the cutaneous nerves at the base of 
hair follicles.
•Pre- and Post-exposure prophylaxis
•Vaccine & Rabies immune globulin (HRIG)Poliovirus
•Picornavirus
•Enters through GI tract
•Non-enveloped, (+) ssRNA
•Enter through GI tract, usually 
from fecally contaminated 
materialPolio Pathogenesis
•Replicates in oropharynx and 
intestine, submucosal lymphoid 
tissue
•Enters bloodstream- viremia
•Most infections do not progress 
past initial viremia
•Headache and fever common
•Can continue GI replication and 
shedding for weeks to months 
after symptoms subsidePolio Pathogenesis
•In some instances, the viremia 
persists, leading to virus invasion of 
brain and spinal cord
•Virus can enter the CNS directly from 
the blood or by retrograde axonal 
transport in peripheral or cranial 
nerves
•Cytolytic for motor neurons of the 
anterior horn and brain stem
•Destruction of neurons is 
accompanied by inflammatory 
infiltrate and polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, and 
macrophagesOutcomes of Clinical Disease

•Samples
•Throat, feces, CSF
•RT-PCR gold standard
•Virus isolation possible but less 
specific
•No specific antivirals
•Vaccines available
•Inactivated
•Live-attenuatedJC Virus
•Polyomavirus es
•Ubiquitous, nonenveloped, dsDNA 
circular viruses
•Likely respiratory transmission
•Latent infections can be reactivated 
in people whose immune systems are 
suppressed as a result of AIDS, organ 
transplantation, or pregnancy. 
•Causes progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML)
•Approximately 10% of people with AIDS 
develop PML, and the disease is fatal in 
approximately 90% of all cases. JC Pathogenesis
•JC virus crosses the blood-brain 
barrier by replicating in the 
endothelial cells of capillaries . 
•Infection of astrocytes results in 
partial transformation, yielding 
enlarged cells with abnormal 
nuclei resembling 
glioblastomas. 
•Productive lytic infections of 
oligodendrocytes cause 
demyelinationProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML)
•A subacute demyelinating disease that 
occurs in immunocompromised patients, 
including those with AIDS
•Patients may have multiple neurologic 
symptoms not attributable to a single 
anatomic lesion. 
•Speech, vision, coordination, 
mentation, or a combination of 
these functions is impaired, followed 
by paralysis of the arms and legs and 
finally death. People who are 
diagnosed with PML live 1 to 4 
months, and most die within 2 years.Extra: SSPE and Measles
•Measles
•Paramyxovirus
•Enveloped, negative-sense RNA 
virus
•Koplik spots
•Rash: head-to-toes
•Subacte sclerosing 
panencephalitis (SSPE)
