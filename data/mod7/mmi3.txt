•Meningitis
•Bacterial
•Fungal
•Parasitic
•Viral
•Encephalitis
•Viral
•Fungal/Parasitic
•Other
•Toxins
•Infectious polyneuropathies
•PrionsFungal Meningitis Clinical Cues:
•Presentation is similar to 
bacterial meningitis
•Fever, nuchal rigidity, altered 
mental status (classic triad)
•Severe headache, rash, 
photophobia, nausea/vomiting, 
•Fungal meningitis is not 
contagious person to person
•Typically from a primary lung 
infection with spread
•Prevalent in immunocompromised
•Progression may be more 
gradual in nature with initial 
mild symptoms

Adapted from Schaechter ’s Mechanisms of Microbial Diseases, 5 th edition, 2013* = PMN may predominate in first 24hCryptococcus neoformans
•Opportunistic, encapsulated, 
yeast-like fungus 
(monomorphic)
•Replication is by budding
•Extracellular polysaccharide 
capsule
•Major virulence factor
•Inhibits phagocytosis
•Worldwide distribution
•Ubiquitous in soil, pigeon 
droppings
•Usually acquired by inhaling 
aerosolized cells from 
environment
C. neoformans meningitis: Clinical
•Can cause life-threatening 
encephalitis or 
meningoencephalitis following 
respiratory infection and 
dissemination
•Fever, headache, visual 
disturbances, abnormal mental 
status, seizures
•Increased intracranial pressure 
common
•HIGHLY dependent on patient’s 
immune status
•But, can still occur in 
immunocompetent hostsC. neoformans: Diagnosis & Treatment
•DIAGNOSIS
•The encapsulated yeast can be seen 
in India-ink-stained preparations of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
•Latex agglutination test for the 
capsular polysaccharide antigen
•Culture possible, urease positive 
yeast
•TREATMENT
•Antifungal drugs amphotericin B and 
flucytosine in combination is 
recommended, the former 
penetrating poorly into CSF
•Fluconazole after culture negative, 
min 10 weeks
Bonus: Other Fungal Pathogens to Consider
•Histoplasma capsulatum, 
Blastomyces dermatitidis, 
Coccidioides immitis, 
Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida 
albicans, Rhizopus spp. 
(mucormycosis)
•Most of these typically 
classified with primary 
respiratory infections by spores
•Spread to CNS all possible 
Major Parasitic CNS Infections
•Free-living, invasive amoebae:
•Naegleria
•Acanthamoeba
•Balamuthia
•Chronic Brain Abscesses:
•Toxoplasma gondi
•Taenia solium (cyticercosis)
•Presentation and CSF profiles 
and test vary widely
•Serology, PCR, imaging, etc
•Eosinophilia possible but very 
uncommonFree-living amoebae: Epidemiology and 
Transmission
•Found in soil and in contaminated 
lakes, streams, and other water 
environments
•Usually acquired when people are 
swimming in contaminated water
•CAN affect healthy individuals 
with no obvious defect in 
immunity.
•ALTHOUGH immunocompromised 
patients are at risk
•Inhalation of cysts also possibleMechanisms of pathogenesis
•Colonization of nasal passages (is 
usually asymptomatic)
•Inhalation or trauma may allow 
ameba to reach the meninges via 
the olfactory tract and cribriform 
plate.
•Invade nasal mucosa and extend 
into the brain
•It is thought that Naegleria fowleri 
penetrates the CNS through 
traumatic gaps in the cribiform plate 
or forceful entry into the 
nasopharynx, allowing access to the 
olfactory bulbs, perhaps induced 
when a person dives into water 
containing the organismsNaegleria fowleri
Amoebic 
meningoencephalitisAcanthamoeba & Balamuthia
granulomatous amoebic 
encephalitis
Amoebic meningoencephalitis: Naegleria 
fowleri
•Primary amebic meningoencephalitis 
caused by Naegleria affects healthy 
individuals with no obvious defect in 
immunity.
•The disease shows a rapid onset, and 
the mortality rate is high
•Destruction of brain tissue with 
edema and is characterized by a 
fulminant, rapidly fatal hemorrhagic  
meningoencephalitis
•Symptoms:  intense frontal 
headache, sore throat, fever, blocked 
nose with altered senses of taste and 
smell, stiff neckNaegleria trophozoites Giemsa stainGranulomatous amoebic encephalitis: 
Acanthamoeba  & Balamuthia
•They more commonly affect those 
who are already unwell or 
immunocompromised and are 
thought to enter via cysts or 
trophozoites through the skin or 
the respiratory tract.
•Found in soli, air, water, biofilms
•Edema of brain tissue
•Subacute-chronic infection with 
prolonged course
•Weeks to months increasing 
headache, low grade fever, visual 
disturbance, behavior changes, 
neurologic deficitsDiagnosis & Treatment: Amebas
•SAMPLES:
•CSF may have RBCs, increased 
leukocytes/protein, decreased glucose
•Microscopy
•Naegleria: appear as slowly motile 
amoebae (difficult)
•TROPHOZOITES only, can be seen in CSF
•Stain: iodine, Giemsa
•Acanthamoeba & Balamuthia :
•TROPHOZOITES & CYSTS in tissue biopsy, 
rarely seen in CSF
•Culture: agar plates seeded with Gram- 
enteric bacilli (for nutrition)
•PCR is available but not widely in use
•Treatment is largely ineffective:
•Amphotericin B, with combinations of 
fluconazole/ rifampin/ miltefosine 
/azithromycin possible
Acanthamoeba  trophozoite 
in tissue H&E stainToxoplasma gondii
•Blood & tissue Protozoan 
intracellular parasite
•Definitive host - cat and other 
feline
•Essential reservoir in which 
parasite passes through its adult 
and sexual existence
•Intermediate hosts- poultry, 
rodents, cattle, etc
•Host in which parasite passes its 
larval or nonsexual existenceToxoplasma gondii 
Life Cycle:
1.Infectious oocysts
Oocysts are ingested

HTML/Image_Library.htmToxoplasma gondii 
Life Cycle:
1.Infectious oocysts
2.Mature into tachyzoites
www.cdc.gov
These are rapidly multiplying 
and are responsible for the 
initial infection and tissue 
damageToxoplasma gondii 
Life Cycle:
1.Infectious oocysts
2.Mature into tachyzoites
3 & 4. 
These tachyzoites localize in 
neural and muscle tissue and 
develop into tissue cyst 
bradyzoites
•Parasite are not eliminated, 
but form dormant tissue 
cysts in different parts of the 
body
•In an immunosuppressed 
host, infections is activated 
and disseminates often to 
CNS Toxoplasmic encephalitis
•Acute disease:
•Chills, fever, headaches, myalgia, 
cervical lymphadenopathy, and fatigue
•Congenital:
•Chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications, 
hydrocephalus
•Can be decades later when cysts rupture
•Reactivation (immunocompromised)
•Usually multifocal, lesion appear in brain 
•Symptoms are related to the location of 
lesions
•Seizures, visual impairment, confusion 
•Other sites of infection include eye, 
lung, testesToxoplasma Diagnosis & Treatment
•Serologic testing in acute phase
•Diagnosis in an 
immunocompromised patient is 
likely to be reactivation
•Antibody detection is difficult
•CSF, blood, tissue
•Histological 
•PCR
•Treatment:
•Pyrimethamine plus either 
sulfadiazine or clindamycinTaenia solium
•Tapeworm
•Life cycle in pigs
•Humans are infected by eating 
undercooked pork
• It is endemic in Mexico, Central and 
South America, and parts of Africa, 
Asia, and India
• is an increasingly common medical 
problem in the United States, 
especially in the Southwest and other 
areas of heavy emigration from 
endemic areas or in populations with 
significant travel to these areasT. solium pathogenesis
•Ingested, eggs hatch in stomach 
and resulting oncospheres 
penetrate intestinal wall and get 
into blood stream
•Larvae lodge into brain tissue (also 
muscle, connective tissue, lungs, 
eyes)
•Forms calcified granulomas
•Death of larvae results in the 
release of antigenic material that 
stimulates a marked inflammatory 
reaction
•Fever
•EosinophiliaClinical: Neurocysticercosis (cysticercotic 
encephalopathy)
•Cysticercosis results from 
infection with the larval stage 
•Larvae can lodge in the brain 
tissue or eye, cyst growth or 
potentially rupture induces 
symptoms
•Hydrocephalus
•Meningitis
•Cranial nerve damage
•Seizures (often spontaneous, 
adult)
•Visual defectsCysticercosis Diagnosis & Treatment
•Cysticercosis should be considered 
in any patient from an endemic 
area presenting with these 
symptoms
•Diagnosis is by detecting specific 
antibody in serum or CSF 
(interestingly, there is a higher 
positivity rate in serum than in 
CSF), and visualizing cysts 
preferably by MRI scan. 
•Treatment is with albendazole or 
praziquantel under corticosteroid 
cover
•Anti-epileptics if presents w/ seizureBonus: Other Helminths & Protozoa to Consider
•Trichinella spiralis cysts
•Filariasis (ie Wucheria bancrofti, 
Strongyloides stercoralis ) 
blockage
•Schistosoma mansoni eggs or 
fluke
•Toxocaris canis larvae migration
•Echinococcus granulosus 
cerebral hydatid cyst
•Plasmodium falciparum cerebral 
malaria

hereditary, and transmissible forms 
of disease, they are relentlessly 
progressive and uniformly fatal.

•Associated with spongiform 
encephalopathy
•Presence of small vacuoles within

spongiform appearance, neuronal 
loss, and glial cell proliferation
•Occur in the absence of an 
inflammatory response
