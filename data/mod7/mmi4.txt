1.Identify the etiologies and different clinical presentations of 
bacterial and viral conjunctivitis
2.Review infections associated with contact lens use
3.Identify bacterial and viral pathogens that can directly or indirectly 
cause symptoms in muscle tissue
4.Overview Eukaryotic pathogens that can invade eye or muscle 
tissue and induce pathogenesisConjunctivitis
•Red eye and discharge
•Usually benign and self-limiting
•Rule out sight-threatening and 
pathologic processes
•Bacterial, viral, parasitic, 
noninfectiousBacterial Conjunctivitis
•Typically spread by direct 
contact
•Highly contagious
•Redness, thick purulent 
discharge , one or both eyes, 
‘stuck shut’ in mornings
•Discharge at lid margins and 
corners of eye
Bacterial etiologies
•S. aureus , S. pneumoniae , H. 
influenzae , Moraxella 
catarrhalis are common 
etiologies
•S. aureus common in adults
•Neisseria  species can cause 
hyperacute conjunctivitis
•Severe and threatens sight
•Neisseria and Chlamyida are 
congenital pathogens presenting 
with conjunctivitis
•Chlamydia trachomatis associated 
w/ trachoma and preventable 
blindness in endemic areas
Viral Conjunctivitis
•Injection conjunctivitis, watery or 
mucoserous discharge, burning, 
sandy, gritty feeling
•Starts in one eye, 2nd eye usually 
involved within 1-2 days
•May be a prodrome associated
•Fever, adenopathy, pharyngitis, URTI
•Adenovirus, multiple serotypes 
implicated
•Non-enveloped, dsDNA linear
•Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis: 
Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19, 37
•Congenital w/ eye symptoms:
•Measles, Rubella, CMV
Contact Lenses
•Patients are at risk for 
secondary conjunctivitis
•Soft lens: pseudomonal keratitis
•Acute red eye, discharge, 
ulcerative keratitis
•Topical and systemic antibiotics 
based on local resistance profiles
•Gram – rod, oxidase +, blue-green 
pyocyanin, fruity odor, Lactose –, 
capsule/slime layer, flagella
•Exotoxin A: EF-2 protein inhibitionAmoebas and Contact Lenses
•Acanthamoeba
•Can visualize trophozoites in corneal 
scrapings
•Infect cornea, keratitis most 
common presentation
•Tearing, foreign body sensation, 
pain, photophobia
•Ring-shaped stromal infiltrates
•Poor cleaning/maintenance or 
direct trauma
•Long wear periods
•Isolated in lens cases, lens solution
•Non-sterile water use for preparation
Acanthamoeba  Infection Routes
Other Parasitology in Eye
•Toxoplasmosis
•Toxoplasma gondii
•Tissue cysts in retina of fetus
•River blindness
•Onchocerca volvulus (nematode)
•Biting flies, larvae invade eye and 
induce robust inflammatory 
response
•Other parasitic worms
•Echinococcus  egg can encyst in eye
•Toxocara canis migratory larvae
•Eosinophilic inflammatory response
•Uveitis, retinal granuloma, traction 
bands, retinal detachmentMuscle
•Usually hematogenous spread
•Skin infections that become 
necrotic and spread
•Parasitic etiologies can form 
tissue cysts in muscle
•Viral direct infection
•Coxsackie virus, EchovirusPyomyositis
•Purulent infection of skeletal 
muscle from hematogenous 
spread, usually w/ abscess
•Fever, pain, localized cramping
•Increased pain, edema, fever spike
•Systemic toxicity
•Associated w/ the tropics, 
immunosuppression, trauma
•S. aureus most common, GAS 2nd 
most common
•Clostridial, necrotizing fasciitis 
other common soft tissue 
infectionsViral infections and muscle aches
•Common in back, proximal extremities
•Self limited, cytokines
•Benign acute childhood myositis
•Acute infections in children, 
pain/tenderness usually in the calves, 
commonly with influenza
•Viral myositis with rhabdomyolysis
•Muscle necrosis, possibly w/ direct 
infection of muscle tissue, myotoxic 
cytokines, immune damage
•Usually history of URTI/GI symptoms
•Severe muscle pain, swelling, mental 
changes, systemic complications
•Coxsackie, Echovirus,  Influenza, EBV, HSV, 
PIV, Adenovirus, CMV, Measles, VZV, HIV, 
DENV
•Chronic viral myositis
•Echovirus, HIVParasitology and Muscle
•Toxoplasmosis
•Toxoplasma gondii
•Tissue cyst bradyzoites
•Trypanosomes
•Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas)
•Reduviid bug, Trypomastigotes invade 
muscle
•Nematode
•Trichinella spiralis
•Consume meat w/ larvae
•Tapeworms
•Echinococcus granulosus
•Taenia solium
•Larvae invade muscle and form cystsObjectives
