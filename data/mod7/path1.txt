diagnostic tests seen with rheumatoid arthritis, gout, 
pseudogout and osteoarthritis Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
•Infarction of bone and marrow
–Can involve cortex and medulla or just medulla
–Most are caused by fractures or corticosteroid 
administration
–Other conditions predisposing one for 
osteonecrosis:
•Alcohol abuse
•Bisphosphonate therapy
•Connective tissue disorders
•Chronic pancreatitis
•Gaucher Disease
•Dysbarism (the bends)
•Sickle Cell Crisis
•TumorsOsteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
•Pathogenesis:
–Vascular insufficiency 
through mechanical 
injury to blood vessels, 
thromboembolism, 
external pressure on 
vessels, or venous 
occlusionOsteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
•Clinical:
–Symptoms depend on the location and 
extent of infarction
•Subchondral infarcts : Pain that is initially 
associated only with activity but then 
becomes constant as secondary changes 
supervene
•Medullary infarcts : Small and clinically 
silent except when they occur in the 
setting of Gaucher disease, dysbarism (the 
bends) and sickle cell anemiaOsteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
•Morphology:
–Medullary infarcts
•Geographic and involve the 
trabecular bone and marrow
–Subchondral infarcts
•A triangular or wedge-shaped 
segment of tissue that has the 
subchondral bone plate as its 
base undergoes necrosis
•Overlying articular cartilage 
remains viableOsteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)

Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
•Histology:
–Dead bone = empty lacunae 
surrounded by necrotic 
adipocytes that frequently 
rupture
–Healing bone = osteoclasts resorb 
the necrotic trabeculae. 
–Creeping Substitution = 
Trabeculae that remain act as 
scaffolding for the deposition of 
new boneOsteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
Necrotic bone – lacunae are empty and marrow 
is necrotic

Creeping Substitution – necrotic bone is being 
replaced with new bone
OsteomyelitisOsteomyelitis
•Inflammation of bone and 
marrow, virtually always 
secondary to infection
•May be a complication of any 
systemic infection
•Frequently manifests as a 
primary solitary focus of 
disease
•Viruses, parasites, fungi, and 
bacteria can all produce 
osteomyelitisOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Caused by bacteria
•Reach bone by hematogenous 
spread or extension from a 
contiguous site or direct 
transplantation 
•Most often occurs as a 
complication of open fractures, 
surgical procedures and diabetic 
infections of the feetOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for 80-
90% of the causes of culture-positive pyogenic 
osteomyelitis
•Also frequent: 
–E coli
–Pseudomonas – Diabetic and IV drug users
–Klebsiella
•Neonatal osteomyelitis:
–Haemophilus influenzae 
–Group B streptococci
•Sickle Cell osteomyelitis:
–Salmonella!Osteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•The location of the bone infections is 
influenced by the vascular circulation 
which varies with age
•Neonate: Frequent infection of the 
metaphysis, epiphysis or both
•Children: Localization of microorganisms 
in the metaphysis  is typical
•Adults: Bacteria to seed the epiphyses 
and subchondral regions which are 
common sites of infectionOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis 
•Clinical Course
–Hematogenous osteomyelitis
•Acute systemic illness with 
malaise, fever, chills, 
leukocytosis, and marked 
throbbing pain over the 
affected region
•May be subtle in infants
•May be localized pain in 
adultsOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Clinical:
–In 5-25% of cases, acute 
osteomyelitis failure to 
resolve and persists as 
chronic infection
–The course of chronic 
infections may be 
interrupted by acute flare-
upsOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Clinical:
•Other complications: 
–Pathologic fracture
–Secondary Amyloidosis
–Endocarditis
–Sepsis
–Development of squamous cell 
carcinoma in the draining sinus tracts
–Sarcoma in the infected boneOsteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Morphology:
•Acute: Neutrophilic infiltration of bone. 
Necrosis of bone and marrow within 48 
hours
–Bacteria may percolate throughout 
the Haversian systems to reach the 
periosteum
–Subperiosteal abscesses form in 
children – cause long dissections
•Chronic: Fibrosis of marrow space , bone 
remodeling and lymphocyte aggregatesOsteomyelitis
Acute Chronic
Osteomyelitis
•Sequestrum : Necrotic bone 
•Involucrum : The new bone 
laid down by the periosteum 
that surrounds the sequestra
•Cloaca: The opening in the 
involucrum through which 
pus and sequestra make their 
way out
Osteomyelitis
Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
•Diagnosis:
–Radiographic findings of a lytic 
focus of bone destruction 
surrounded by a zone of 
sclerosis
–Biopsy and bone cultures are 
required to identify the 
pathogenOsteomyelitis

OsteoporosisOsteoporosis
•Osteopenia = decreased bone mass
•Osteoporosis = Osteopenia severe 
enough to significantly increase the 
risk of fracture
•Osteoporosis = Bone mass at least 
2.5 standard deviations below mean 
peak bone mass in young adults
•The presence of an atraumatic or 
vertebral compression fracture 
signifies osteoporosis
•Most common forms are the senile 
and postmenopausal typesOsteoporosis
•Pathogenesis:
–Normal age related 
bone loss may average 
0.7% per year due to:
•Age related changes
•Reduced physical activity
•Genetic Factors
•Calcium nutritional state
•Hormonal influences Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis
•Morphology:
–Histologically normal bone that is 
decreased in quantity 
–Postmenopausal:
•Cancellous compartment of vertebral 
bodies (Bones which have increased 
surface areas)
•Trabecular plates become perforated, 
thinned and lose their interconnections 
–Progressive microfractures and 
vertebral collapse
–Senile:
•Cortex is thinned by subperiosteal and 
endosteal resorption and the Haversian 
systems are widened Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis
•Clinical:

painful  loss of height and 
deformities like lumbar 
lordosis and kyphoscoliosis 
–Complications of fractures of 
femoral neck, pelvis, spine:

OsteomalaciaOsteomalacia
•Vitamin D Deficiency in Adults
–Results in excess of unmineralized  
matrix

vitamin D as well as limited exposure to 
sunlight
–Prevented by a diet high in fish oils
–Other causes:
•Renal disorders causing decreased 
synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
•Phosphate depletion
•Malabsorption disorders
•Rare inherited disordersOsteomalacia
•Morphology:
–Deranges the normal bone 
remodeling
–Newly formed osteoid matrix 
laid down by osteoblasts is 
inadequately mineralized, thus 
producing the excess of 
persistent osteoid
–Bone is weak and vulnerable 
to fractures of vertebral bodies 
and femoral necks
–Unmineralized osteoid  
thickened layer of matrix 
arranged about normally 
mineralized trabeculae Osteomalacia

RicketsRickets
•Vitamin D deficiency in 
ChildrenRickets
•Morphology:
–Overgrowth of epiphyseal cartilage due to inadequate 
calcification and failure of the cartilage cells to mature 
and disintegrate 
–Distorted irregular masses of cartilage which project 
into the marrow cavity
–Deposition of osteoid matrix on inadequately 
mineralized cartilage
–Disruption of the orderly replacement of cartilage by 
osteoid matrix with enlargement and lateral 
expansion of the osteochondral junction 
–Microfractures can occur the inadequately mineralized  
weak poorly formed bone
–Deformation of the skeleton due to the loss of 
structural rigidity of the developing bonesRickets

•Chronic inflammatory 
disorder of autoimmune 
origin that attacks the 
joints
–*producing a non-
proliferative and 
inflammatory synovitis*
•Destruction of the articular 
cartilage and ankylosis of 
the jointsRheumatoid Arthritis
•Pathogenesis:
–Genetic predisposition and 
environmental factors
•HLA-DRB1
•PTPN22 Gene
–CD4+ T helper (TH) cells
•*Initiate the autoimmune 
response in RA by reacting 
with an arthitogenic agent* Rheumatoid Arthritis
•Pathogenesis:
–T cells produce cytokines that 
stimulate other inflammatory 
cells
•INF-ɣ 
•IL-17
•TNF and IL-1
•RANKLRheumatoid Arthritis
•Pathogenesis:
–The synovium of RA contains 
germinal centers with secondary 
follicles *and abundant plasma cells 
with produce antibodies, some of 
which are against self antigens*
–Autoantibodies against Citrullinated 
peptides (CCPs)
•Antibody complexes are deposited into 
the joints
•CCP autoantibodies are diagnostic for 
RA
–IgM or IgA Autoantibodies to the Fc 
portions of IgG = Rheumatoid FactorRheumatoid Arthritis

•Morphology:
–Joints:
•These changes produce a PANNUS
–Mass of edematous synovium, 
inflammatory cells, granulation 
tissue, and fibroblasts that grows 
over the articular cartilage
–Pannus bridges the apposing 
bones to form a fibrous ankylosis 
which will ossify and fuse the 
bones = boney ankylosisRheumatoid Arthritis

2.Sterile turbid synovial 
fluid with decreased 
viscosity, poor mucin clot 
formation and inclusion-
bearing neutrophils

Rheumatoid Factor and 
Anti-CCP antibody OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis
•Degenerative joint disease 
characterized by 
degeneration of cartilage 
that results in structural 
and functional failure of 
synovial joints
•Intrinsic disease of cartilage 
in which chondrocytes 
respond to biochemical and 
mechanical stresses 
resulting in breakdown of 
matrixOsteoarthritis
•Pathogenesis:
1.Chondrocyte injury, related to genetic 
and biochemical factors
2.Early OA – chondrocytes proliferate and 
secrete inflammatory mediators,   
initiate secondary inflammatory 
changes in the synovium and 
subchondral bone
3.Late OA – repetitive injury and chronic 
inflammation lead to chondrocyte drop 
out, marked loss of cartilage and 
extensive subchondral bone changesOsteoarthritis
•Pathogenesis:
–Collagen Type II is 
degraded by matrix 
metalloproteinases
–Cytokines – TGF-β, TNF, 
prostaglandin and NO 
have been implicated
–Environmental and genetic 
influences contribute 
•Aging and biomechanical 
stressOsteoarthritis
•Morphology: 
–Early stages:
•Chondrocytes proliferate 
forming clusters (cloning)
•Water content of the matrix 
increases and the concentration 
of proteoglycans decreases
•Fissures and clefts at the 
articular surface are formed as 
the cartilage is degradedOsteoarthritis
•Morphology: 
–Later stages:
•Full-thickness portions of the 
cartilage are sloughed

•Hips, knees, lower lumbar and cervical 
vertebrae, proximal and distal interphalangeal 
joints of fingers, first carpometacarpal joints 
and first tarsometatarsal joints of feetOsteoarthritis
GoutGout
•Gout is the end point of a group of 
disorders that produce hyperuricemia
•Transient attacks of acute arthritis 
initiated by crystallization of urates 
within and about joints, leading to 
deposition of masses of urates in joints 
and other sites, creating tophi
•Tophi are formed = large aggregates of 
urate crystals and the surrounding 
inflammatory reaction
•Plasma Urate level about 7 mg/dL is 
considered elevatedGout
•Pathogenesis
–Uric acid is the end product of purine 
metabolism
1.De novo pathway – purines are 
synthesized from nonpurine precursors
2.Salvage pathway – free purine bases 
derived from the breakdown of nucleic 
acids of endogenous or exogenous 
origin are recaptured
1.Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (HGPRT) Gout
•Pathogenesis
–Factors that contribute to the 
conversion of asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia into primary gout: 
•Age 
•Genetic predisposition
•Heavy alcohol consumption
•Obesity
•Drugs like thiazides
•Lead toxicity (saturine gout)Gout
Gout
•Pathogenesis
–Precipitation of monosodium urate 
crystals into the joints!
•Urates in the joints become 
supersaturated 
•Peripheral Joints
•Crystals and microtophi develop in the 
synovium and cartilage
–Crystals are released into synovial fluid
–Chemotactic for lymphocytes, 
neutrophils, macrophages
–Complement activated with 
accumulations of neutrophils and 
macrophages
–Phagocytosis of crystals = free radicals
–Neutrophils release lysosomal enzymesGoutGout
•Morphology:
1.Acute arthritis
2.Chronic tophaceous 
arthritis
3.Tophi at various sites
4.Gouty nephropathy Gout
•Morphology:
1.Acute arthritis
–Dense neutrophilic infiltrate 
of synovium and synovial 
fluid 
–Crystals found in neutrophil 
cytoplasm and synovium
–Needle shaped crystals that 
are negatively birefringent
–Acute attacks remit Gout
•Crystals are found to be birefringent , =  they 
demonstrate double refraction (having two 
indices of refraction). 
•Light polarized parallel to the director has a 
different index of refraction than light 
polarized perpendicular to the director.
•Negative birefringence – ye llow when is 
parallel to the light, and blue when is 
perpendicular.

foot. Each episode follows a meal in which he consumes a bottle of red wine, and the pain may last 
houses to several days. Physical exam identifies the right metatarsophalangeal joint as the focus of this 
pain. There is tenderness and swelling, but overlying ulcerated skin is present on the lateral aspect of 
the metatarsophalangeal joint. Beneath the eroded skin is a chalky soft tissue. A firm, 1-cm 
subcutaneous nodule is present on the extensor surface of the left elbow. The nodule is excised and has 
the microscopic appearance shown in the figure. Which of the following mechanisms is most important 
in causing joint injury in his disease? 
A.Activation of neutrophils by phagocytosis 
of urate crystals
B.Chronic inflammation caused by 
Borrelia burgdorferi infection
C.Release of TNF causing acute joint inflammation
D.Deposition of serum cholesterol into the synovium
E.Granulomatous inflammation caused by 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
F.Reduced metabolism of homogentisic acid
