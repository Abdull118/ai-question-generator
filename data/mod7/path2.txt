Malignant Tumors of Bone 
Cartilage and Soft Tissue
Dr. Rachael ConningtonOsteomaOsteoma
•Benign, round, slow growing sessile 
tumors that project from the 
subperiosteal or endostea surfaces of 
the cortex
•Subperiosteal osteomas  skull and 
facial bones
•craniofacial bones  paranasal sinuses!
•pain, headache, facial distortion, proptosis, 
visual changes, sinusitis, meningitis
•Solitary
•Middle aged adults
•Association with Gardner Syndrome!!!Gardners Syndrome
•Subtype of FAP (Familial 
Adenomatous Polyposis)
•Mutations of the APC gene
•Multiple adenomatous colon 
polyps  increased risk of 
colorectal carcinoma 
•Multiple benign tumors, including: 
•sebaceous cysts
•epidermoid cysts
•Fibromas
•desmoid tumors
•Osteomas!!!Osteoma
Osteoma
OsteosarcomaOsteosarcoma
•Malignant mesenchymal tumor 
 Cancerous cells produce 
bone matrix
•Most common primary 
malignant tumor of bone
•Bimodal: 10-14 years and >65
•Associated with Paget disease!
•Arises in the Metaphyseal 
region of long bones of 
extremities
•Around the KneeOsteosarcoma
•Most common Osteosarcomas:
•Arise from the metaphysis of long 
bones
•primary, 
•solitary, 
•intramedullary ad 
•poorly differentiated and 
•produces a bony matrix
•Formation of poorly formed 
osteoid bone by tumor cells is 
characteristic 
•Stain positive for Alkaline 
phosphatase! Osteosarcoma

Osteosarcoma
•Painful and progressively 
enlarging
•Fracture of bone
•Radiographs:
•Large, destructive, mixed lytic 
and blastic mass that has 
permeative margins
•Breaks through cortex and 
lifts periosteum  Codman 
triangle
• Metastases to lungsPaget Disease (Osteitis Deformans)
•Disordered Osteoclast and osteoblast 
activity
•Furious osteoclastic bone resorption 
followed by hectic bone formation 
then bone cell activity becomes 
diminished 
•Repetitive and overlapping sequence
1.Osteolytic stage
2.Mixed osteoclastic-osteoblastic stage 
3.Burnt-out quiescent osteosclerotic 
stagePaget Disease
•Mid-adulthood
•Common in whites in Europe 
and United States
•Caused by paramyxovirus 
•IL-6 and M-CSF
•Abnormal osteoclasts that are 
hyper-responsive to RANKL and 
vitamin D
•Linked to locus on Chromosome 
18q Paget Disease
•Morphology:
•Hallmark = Mosaic pattern of lamellar 
bone – Jigsaw puzzle
•Lytic phage  marked osteoclast 
activity with numerous resorption pits
•Mixed phase  bone surfaces now 
lined by osteoblasts
•Quiescent phase  fibrovascular tissue 
recedes
•End product = Larger than normal 
coarsely thicken trabeculae and 
cortices that are soft and porous and 
lack structural stabilityPaget Disease
Paget Disease
•Clinical:
•Elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase 
•Increased urinary excretion of 
hydroxyproline
•Axial skeleton or proximal femur 
involved in 80%
•Localized pain!
•Bone overgrowth of cranium and 
craniofacial bones
•Severe secondary osteoarthritis
•At risk for developing 
Osteosarcoma!Paget Disease

Primary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone 
TumorsPrimary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone 
Tumors•Primary bone tumors are much less common 
than Metastases in adults older than 45 years!
•The most common cancers that spread to 
bone:
•Breast
•Lung
•Thyroid
•Kidney
•Prostate
•After lung and liver, the skeleton is the most 
common site for metastasis
•Spine
•Pelvis
•Ribs
•Skull
•Upper arm
•Long bones of the legPrimary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone 
Tumors
•Metastatic tumor can completely 
destroy the bone = osteolytic bone 
destruction. 
•Most common in lung, thyroid, kidney, 
and colon cancers
•New bone can form in response to the 
cancer spread = osteoblastic growth  
•Grows abnormally and causes the bone 
to be weak and deformed
•More common in prostate, bladder, and 
stomach cancer
•Breast cancer often behaves in a 
mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic 
mannerPrimary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone 
Tumors
•Pain
•Pathologic fractures 
•Nerve damage or 
paralysis with 
vertebral bone 
metastasis 
•Anemia 
Primary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone 
Tumors
•The diagnosis of metastatic bone disease 
should not be assumed unless a patient has 
a known primary cancer that has 
previously spread to bone
•A biopsy may be necessary
•Blood chemistries (i.e., electrolytes, 
calcium, and alkaline phosphatase) may be 
abnormal in patients with widespread 
disease. 
•A urinalysis can detect blood  renal cell 
carcinoma. 
•Thyroid function tests, CEA, CA125, and 
PSA may be abnormal in patients with 
specific tumors.
• Serum and urine protein electrophoresis 
 multiple myeloma.Primary Bone Tumors Vs Metastatic Bone

Questions•A 70-year old man complains of right hip and thigh pain of several 
months’ duration. On physical exam, he has reduced range of motion in 
both hips, but there is no tenderness or swelling on palpation. 
Radiographs of the pelvis and right leg show sclerotic thickened cortical 
bone with a narrowed joint space near the acetabulum. Lab studies show 
a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 173 U/L, calcium of 9.5 mg/dL and 
phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL. A bone biopsy is performed and the microscopic 
appearance of the specimen is shown above. Which of the following 
conditions is most likely to produce these findings?
A.Osteochondroma
B.Vitamin D deficiency
C.Degenerative Osteoarthritis
D.Hyperparathyroidism

hip and right shoulder pain for the past 6 years. He reports that he has 
had to buy larger hats. On physical exam, there is no joint swelling, 
erythema, warmth or tenderness, but the range of motion is reduced. 
Radiographs of the affected joints show narrowing of the joint spaces 
with adjacent boney sclerosis. A skull radiograph shows thickening of the 
skull bone. A bone biopsy at the iliac crest shows a loss of normal 
trabeculae with a mosaic pattern and increased numbers of osteoclasts 
and osteoblasts. Which of the following complications is the patient most 
likely to suffer as a result of this condition? 
A.Ankylosing spondylitis
B.Osteoma 
C.Fibrous dysplasia
D.Osteosarcoma

tenderness on deep palpation of the left side of the groin. There is a 
reduction in the range of motion of the left hip. There is no swelling 
or warmth to the tough. Pelvic and left leg radiographs show an 
upper femoral mass lesion arising in the metaphyseal region and 
eroding the surrounding bone cortex. The proximal femur is excised 
and on sectioning has the gross appearance shown. Which of the 
following cell types is most likely to be proliferating in this mass? 
A.Osteoblasts
B.Chondroblasts

the right knee for the past 3 months. There are no physical findings, 
except for the local pain over the area of the distal right femur. A 
radiograph of the right left shows an ill-defined mass involving the 
metaphyseal area of the distal right femur and there is elevation of 
the adjacent periosteum. A bone biopsy specimen shows large, 
hyperchromatic pleomorphic spindle cells forming and osteoid 
matrix. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A.Ewing Sarcoma
B.Chondrosarcoma
