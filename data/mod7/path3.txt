Dr. BahriNeuropathology: Muscular 
pathologyObjectives:
1.Evaluate the utility of creatine kinase, muscle biopsy, and 
special histochemical stains in the diagnosis of muscular 
disorders
2.Outline the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers in the 
process of denervation and re-innervation
3.Distinguish between the morphology and clinical 
manifestations of Duchenne and Becker muscular 
dystrophy
4.Discuss the pathogenesis, morphology, and clinical 
manifestations of Myastenia gravis and Myotonic 
dystrophyCreatine kinase
•Primarily located in muscle 
•Three CK isoenzymes 
CK-MM 
Accounts for >95% of skeletal muscle CK 
Accounts for 70% to 75% of cardiac muscle CK 
CK-MB 
Primarily in cardiac muscle 
Very small percentage in skeletal muscle 
CK-BB 
Found predominantly in brain and lung Goljan & Slojka Table 9-21Skeletal muscle organization
myocytes
myofibril s (actin and myosin)
myofibers
multiple myofibers make a muscle fiber
multiple fibers are gathered together through 
connective tissue to make a skeletal muscle Normal striated muscle
Rubin’s Fig 27-1 & 27-2There are 2 kinds of muscle fibers
Fast and Slow fibers
In humans, they are combined  in the same muscle bundle. 
In birds such as chickens and turkeys, fast and slow muscle 
fibers are separated , (light meat and dark meat)
Type I, red muscle fibers, slow sustained twitch , fat 
metabolism, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (for posture)  
Type II, white muscle fibers, white meat , fast sudden twitch , 
glycogen metabolism (the slightly sweeter flavor is from the 
glycogen) Type I (slow) vs Type II (fast) fibers
ATPase  stain highlights the 
dark, Type II, muscle fibers

biopsy
•  Type I fibers (Red, slow switch) = stains pale
•  Type II fibers (White, fast twitch) = stains darkHistochemical reactions:
Denervation : seen with nonspecific esterase 
reaction: irregular, dark staining, atrophic, 
angular fibers

reductase (NADH-TR) stain

5Muscle atrophy
FYI:  For an unknown 
reason, disuse atrophy 
and atrophy resulting 
from steroid 
administration affect 
mostly the Type II 
fibers. 
On to the cases…Case #1
A 3 year old boy is brought to the 
pediatrician by his parents because he 
has been having trouble getting up 
from a sitting position, although he had 
previously done so with ease. His 
developmental history is notable for 
delayed motor skills. He began to walk 
at 18 months. The boy has a waddling 
gait, and when sitting he uses his arms 
to push himself into the upright 
position.Case #1
Physical examination:  marked 
muscle weakness of the 
extremities in the proximal 
muscles and hypertrophy of 
the calves. The patient’s 
maternal uncle died at age 
16 and suffered from similar 
symptoms when he was 
younger. Gower sign

•Q1: What serum lab test would be 
elevated in this patient?  
•Q2: What is the most likely diagnosis? 
•Q3: What is the most common 
inheritance pattern of this condition?   
•Q4: The parents have a second son who is 
6 month old. What is the chance that the 2nd 
child will develop this condition?A muscle biopsy is performed, what are the findings 
seen on H&E stain?
Normal Patient Dystrophin immunohistochemical  stain is 
performed
Normal Patient 
Western blot for dystrophin
Questions:
•Q5: If the special stain showed partly 
decreased dystrophin staining, what is the 
diagnosis based upon the staining results?   
•Q6: What is the function of dystrophin?  Case #1 Muscular dystrophy
Case #2
A 25 year old woman has marked 
weakness and drooping of the 
eyelids in the evening for the 
past 4 weeks. She does not 
experience any weakness in the 
morning following a good night’s 
sleep. She also suffers from 
double vision at the end of the 
dayCase #2
Physical examination: Ptosis with 
sustained elevation of eyelids.
Dysphonia develops as patient 
asked to narrate complaints at 
length. Weakness of forward 
flexion of head after repetitive 
resistance to force. Patient 
could not maintain her upper 
limb in abducted position for 
more than a minuteCase #2
Labs: Positive serum titer of anti-acetylcholine 
receptors
EMG: Progressive decrement in voltage during 
repetitive, low frequency stimulation of motor nerve
Improvement in strength with edrophonium 
administration
Diagnosis?
The patient’s thymus gland should also be evaluated for 
what condition(s)?Myasthenia Gravis
Antibodies to the acetylcholine 
receptor on the motor end-plate 
of skeletal muscle cells are the 
problem.
They inhibit neuromuscular 
transmissionMyasthenia Gravis
•Affects more women than men
•Onset usually before age 40 
•Incidence is about 3/100,000
•Thymic hyperplasia occurs in 2/3 of patients
•Thymoma  occurs in 1/3 such patients
•Thymectomy helps symptoms
•No one understands the connection between the disease 
myasthenia gravis and the thymus gland. 
•The Abs are IgG, from B cells.  Yet the thymus is all about T 
cellsMyasthenia Gravis
•Symptoms:
–Drooping eyelids    (ptosis)
–Double vision           (diplopia)
–Difficulty swallowing
–Progressive muscle weakness 
with repeated use
•(repeated electro-
stimulation)Myasthenia Gravis
Case #3
A 35 year old man has distal 
muscle weakness in both the 
upper and lower limbs, and 
gradual diminution of vision.
FH: His father suffered from a 
similar muscular weakness. 
The patient also suffers from 
mental retardationCase #3: Physical 
examination
Frontal balding, facial wasting 
Bilateral cataracts
Distal muscle weakness in the 
upper & lower limbs
Difficulty releasing grip after 
handshake
Mildly reduced DTR’sCase #3: Physical 
examination
Percussion over tongue and 
thenar eminence reveals 
myotonia

dystrophy
Common  form of muscular dystrophy 
among whites
Transmitted as autosomal dominant 
trait
Associated with trinucleotide ( CTG) 
repeats that encode the myotonin 
protein kinase  {Note: there’s an error in the 
video!}

Case #4: 
A 40 year old man with a history of 
insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus presents with tingling, 
numbness, burning, and aching in 
the lower legs and feet. 
HPI: The discomfort is prominent at 
night and is often relieved by 
walking. A soft cushion over the 
feet is helpful to prevent contact 
with bedclothes. The patient takes 
insulin regularlyCase #4: 
PE: Mild weakness. Distal loss of 
position and vibration sense in 
both legs. Bilaterally reduced 
ankle and knee reflexes
Labs: Elevated glycosylated 
hemoglobin (9.5%)
Slowed nerve conduction 
velocities
EMG: Features of denervation
