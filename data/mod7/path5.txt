•2 Questions at the end of powerpoint Part 1 Objective 
•Know the definition and clinical symptoms  of meningitis, 
encephalitis and abscess of the brain.  Clinical symptoms meningitis
• Encephalitis can be characterized by fever, seizures, 
change in behavior, and confusion and disorientation
•Meningitis include some or all of the following: 
•sudden fever, severe headache, nausea or vomiting, double 
vision, drowsiness, sensitivity to bright light, and a stiff 
neck.  encephalitis  shows mild flu-like symptoms. 
•severe cases, people may experience problems with 
speech or hearing, double vision, hallucinations, 
personality changes, and loss of consciousness.   
•complications include loss of sensation in some parts of 
the body, muscle weakness, partial paralysis in the arms 
and legs, impaired judgment, seizures, and memory loss.Objective
•Know that different pathogens use various routes to infect the brain 
(and meninges) and this determines the pathologyRoutes into the CNS
•Nerves
•pathogens travel up nerve bundles
•axoplasmic flow
•Blood stream
•blood-brain barrier
•single layer of tightly packed capillary cells
•keeps out organisms,  viruses or drugs
•can be breached by high concentrations of 
pathogen or drug
•Infections of the face above the mouth
•infections of veins which communicate directly 
to veins of the CNS

•Bones
•bones surround CNS particularly the 
brain
•pathogen must penetrate periosteum
•pathogen must get through the bone
•pathogens can get through from
•sinuses
•mastoids
•middle ear
DOI: 10.1128/CMR.00118-13Objective
•Know lab values to detect infection in the brain and meninges.Diagnosis of CNS infection
•Patients suspected of having meningitis should 
undergo LP.
• In patients at risk for an intracranial mass or midline shift, it 
is recommended that computed tomography (CT) of the head 
be obtained  prior to LP given the potential for brain 
herniation.
•If the clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis is 
high,  empiric antibiotics should be started immediately 
when the LP cannot be performed right away . 
•While the sensitivity of the CSF culture decreases with 
antibiotics, CSF cultures can remain positive for up to 4 
hours afterwards.

Histologic section shows extensive necrosis with 
infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 
macrophages ( asterisks). Numerous  Aspergillus hyphae 
are scattered throughout the section ( arrows), and 
vascular fibrinoid necrosis is present ( arrowheads ) (PAS, 
hematoxylin; original magnification ×40)
MucormycosisMucormycosis •Vascular invasion of the hyphae produces a 
fibrin reaction and the development of 
mucor thrombi, which occlude vessels, 
producing ischemia and infarction. 
•The infarction produces the black, necrotic 
eschars in the nasal and oral cavities and on 
the face that are characteristic of 
mucormycosis
•The infection spreads rapidly to the adjacent 
sinuses and orbit and then continues into 
the cranium via direct extension through the 
ethmoid bone or orbital vessel
