1.Review cerebral edema and the resulting brain herniations  
•Distinguish between the location, morphology,  and clinical 
manifestion of subfalcine, transtentorial (uncinate), and tonsillar 
herniation
2.Review head injuries and the development of coup-coutre coup
3.Distinguish the etiology, morphology, and clinical presentation of 
epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhagesCerebral Edema: Increased pressure
Papilledema: Complication of cerebral edema & 
Increased intracranial pressure
 Always perform a fundoscopic exam to look for papilledema  before 
you perform a lumbar punctureBrain herniations
Subfalcine (cingulate):
• Compression of branches of 
anterior cerebral artery
Transtentorial (uncinate):
• Kernohan ’s notch ( occurs on 
opposite  side of the herniation )
• Duret hemorrhages (upper brain 
stem hemorrhage)
Tonsillar:
• Brainstem compressionTranstentorial (uncinate) herniation
Duret hemorrhage =
•Downward 
compression of the 
midbrain (ie. edema, 
hemorrhage, mass 
lesions) 
•Leads to stretching & 
ischemia of perforating 
arteriolesDuret Hemorrhage
Transtentorial (uncinate) herniation
Kernohan’s notch: (occurs on opposite  side of the herniation ) Clinical findings w/ Transtentorial herniation
Compression of Cranial Nerve 3:
• Ipsilateral eye deviated down & out
• Ipsilateral pupillary dilation
Compression of the posterior cerebral artery
• Contralateral homonymous hemianopsia (ischemia of  visual cortex)
Compression of midbrain cerebral peduncles
• Ipsilateral hemiparesis/hemiplegia
Compression of midbrain
• Decreased respiratory, BP regulatory functionsHead Trauma
•After head trauma, ensure that the patient continues to be 
arousable for several hours afterwards.
•She should not have been left to go back alone.
Check the pupils:
•Are they pin point?
•Do they respond to light?
•Are they equal?Helmets
•They protect against injury, collisions,
•But not against concussion , in their current design.
•The basis of the disruption of nervous activity
    after a concussion is unknownCoup contrecoup brain injury
Coup-contrecoup head injury
•Coup = Injury to brain at site 
of impact
•Contrecoup = Injury to brain at 
opposite site of impact
•Coup-contracoup= Injury at 
both sites of impact
•Causes contusion  (bruising), 
hemorrhage, and edema of 
brain

Shaken Baby Syndrome
One of the most common cause of 
death in children under a year is 
entirely preventable. It's called 
shaken baby syndrome, and it 
means just that -  an infant's 
caretaker picks it up when it is 
crying and gives it a violent shake to 
quiet it down, or several violent 
shakes. Doctors who are experts in 
child abuse say the problem is really 
serous.  
About 2,00 such deaths occur in the US 
per year.
Shaken Baby Syndrome
It is a tear of the bridging veins i.e. It is a subdural  hematomaShaken Baby Syndrome

•Head traumaHead trauma can lead to either epidural or 
subdural hematomas.
Be aware of the elderly patient that falls out 
of bed.
A burr hole relieves the pressure so easily 
and quickly.  
But you have to make the diagnosis!B, Epidural hematoma covering a portion of the dura. C, Large organizing subdural 
hematoma attached to the dura. Epidural hemorrhage
•Convex , lenticular, or lens-shaped appearance on CT scan
•Limited by suture lines
•Head trauma, skull fracture common cause: fall, blunt impact, accident
•Middle meningeal artery most commonly injured

Berry Aneurysms 
They occur often at vascular bifurcations.
They are congenital weaknesses in the smooth   
               muscle of the vascular wall.
They are a cause of instant death when they   
               rupture (subarachnoid hemorrhage)

1.Distinguish the etiology, pathogenic mechanism, and morphology of hemorrhagic and 
ischemic stroke
•Recognize neuronal changes seen in neuronal injury and ischemic infarct
•Associate liquefactive necrosis with ischemic infarct 
2.Identify watershed areas associated with global ischemia
•Recognize the cause of watershed infarcts
3.Distinguish between the etiology of regional and global ischemia
• Distinguish lacunar  from watershed infarcts 
• Recognize the cause and morphology of lacunar infarcts
4.Recognize petechial hemorrhages as a consequence multiple embolism
•Recognize the cause of multiple embolism to the brain
5.Recognize and appraise the use of oral anti-coagulants as a risk for subdural or 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage
•Understand that patients who are on oral anti-coagulants or who have 
coagulopathies are prone to developing cerebral hemorrhagesComplications of cerebrovascular disease
Causes:
•Thrombotic
•Embolic
•Vascular ruptureIschemic
Hemorrhagic
Disruption of blood flow results in:
Hypoxia
Ischemia ( transient  vs permanent )
InfarctionCNS ischemia: The Basics
•Acute ischemic injury leads to “ red neurons ”
•CNS Necrosis  in the first 48 hours is similar to any other tissue: polys 
first, then lymphocytes and  monocytes followed by angiogenesis 
(Liquefactive necrosis ; first 2 weeks)
•Reactive astrocytes come in and wall off the area, and reestablish the 
blood-brain barrier ( Gliosis ; 4 weeks)
•Macrophages  remove necrotic debris, leaving a cystic space crossed 
by delicate small blood vessels and  astrocytic processes  (months), 
i.e. a Pathologist can time the critical event, as s/he can an M.I.Time Gross changes Microscopic changes
0-12 hrs No changes Minimal or no changes
12-24 hrs Minimal changes Red neurons with pyknotic nuclei
24-48 hrs Indistinct gray-white matter 
junctionNeutrophilic  infiltration
2-10 days Friable tissue with marked 
edemaHistiocytic  infiltration; neurons disappear
2-3 weeks Tissue liquefies Liquefactive necrosis ; histiocytes filled with 
products of myelin breakdown
3 weeks-
monthsFluid-filled cavity demarcated 
by gliotic scarFluid-filled cavity; reactive astrocytes & 
lipid-laden macrophages
Years Old cyst surrounded by gliotic 
scarAstrogliosis  surrounding a cystMorphologic changes associated with cerebral 
infarctionEarly CNS infarct: 
Red neurons, Neutrophilic infiltrate
Neuronal injury: Chromatolysis
• Cell swelling
• Peripheral dispersion 
of Nissl substance Neuronal injury:
Red neurons     Axonal spheroids
Late infarction: 
Fluid-filled cavity - Cystic space
Cerebral ischemia/infarctionI. Global cerebral ischemia:
Affects oxygen-sensitive regions of the brain
Decreased oxygenation
•Near-drowning
•Suffocation
•Carbon monoxideDecreased blood flow
•Blood loss
•Cardiac arrest
•HypotensionGlobal ischemia:
Watershed infarcts:
•Occur after hypotensive episodes
•Occur in the border zones  between 
arterial territories
•In the cerebral hemispheres, the 
border zone between the anterior 
and the middle cerebral artery 
distributions is at greatest risk
Global ischemia:
Watershed infarction:
II. Regional cerebral ischemia:
Localized region of the brain 
(vascular distribution)

Common cause of “Vascular Dementia”; Associated 
with hypertension
Lacunar infarcts in CNS: Microscopy

Cerebral vascular accidents (CVA), 
Hemorrhage, & Hypertension:
Spontaneous hemorrhage with long-standing  
(usually uncontrolled) HTN
•Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms : Lipo-
hyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis, and weakened 
wall
• Occurs along vascular trunk (not at 
bifurcation points)
•Affected sites:  Basal ganglia-thalamus(65 %)*

Symptoms of pending hemorrhagic stroke
•A headache that's far worse than anything they've ever had. The 
thing to look for is someone claiming to have 'the worst headache’ 
of their life
•It may mean that they have an aneurysm in the brain that has begun 
to leak a little blood, but could turn into a catastrophic full bleed 
that is life threatening
•Severe nausea or vomiting 
•Any neurologic deficit (such as difficulty speaking or walking, even if 
transient) can be signs of a pending hemorrhagic stroke.Case 1
This is a 56 year old male with a 
history of hypertension, heavy 
tobacco smoking x 40 years, and 
hypercholesterolemia. A carotid 
bruit was noted 1 year  prior to 
the patient's death.  
Autopsy is performed and a section 
of the brain lesion is shown. Case 1: Gross features & Microscopy
Case 1: Liquefactive Necrosis
•Remember, in the CNS , liquefactive necrosis occurs 
 
•Eventually, the liquid is resorbed, and you are left 
with a gaping hole
•What are the possible causes of this patient's 
temporal lobe infarct?Old infarct
Case 2
Compare this case to case #1. Pt was also hypertensive
What are these neuronal changes 
called?Case 2: Hemorrhagic 
infarct
•Hypertension is a leading cause of 
hemorrhagic infarcts
•The increased intravascular pressure 
ruptures the blood vessels
•Red neurons are seen in the area 
surrounding the rupture due to neuronal 
ischemic injuryNext…. Causes of CNS vascular 
Embolism
•Atrial fibrillation
•Mitral and aortic valves vegetations
•Mural thrombi at transmural 
myocardial infarctions
•Ulcerated atheromatous plaques
•Thrombi in pulmonary veins 
•Dislodged  adipose tissue
•Foreign substances (air)Cerebral EmbolismCerebral EmbolismLastly… Coagulopathy 
Complications
1.Hemorrhagic stroke is the most important 
complication of 
•Account for approximately 10% of all 
hemorrhagic strokes
•Hemorrhages are slow to evolve ( “slow 
bleed”) and have a predilection for the 
cerebellum
2.Subdural hematoma : Patients must 
protect themselves from falls and head 
trauma
Causes of Coagulopathies
•Secondary to:
-renal failure
-hepatic failure
-thrombocytopenia
-leukemia
•Treatment with drugs that affect 
coagulation:
-antiplatelet agents
-anticoagulants
-thrombolytic drugsQuestions?
