Spring Semester Objective
•Identify the pathogenic mechanism, 
morphology and clinical manifestations of 
Alzheimer, Parkinson, Pick’s, Huntington's 
disease, and ALS (Polio and Wernig- Hoffman 
for comparison)Neurodegenerative diseases
Dementia:  
Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease, 
Spongiform encephalopathy: 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Movement Disorders:  
Parkinson’s disease/Multi systems 
atrophy and Huntington’s disease
Motor Disease:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 
Werdnig-Hoffman,  and PoliomyelitisDementia: Alzheimer’s diseaseAlzheimers disease:  Clinical features
Clinical features of dementia
•Impairment of recent memory
•Aphasia (comprehension and production of language), 
apraxia (motor), agnosia (inability to interpret sensory 
information), executive functioning (control over what 
one is doing)
•Impaired level of function 
•Progressive over time
•Decreased levels of acetylcholine that occur in the 
disease cause decreased functionAlzheimers microscopic findings: 
Nucleus basalis of Meynert
•A group of neurons in the substantia innominata of the 
basal forebrain, which has wide projections to the 
neocortex  and is rich in acetylcholine
•In Alzheimer disease, these neurons undergo 
degeneration. 
•A decrease in acetylcholine production is seen in 
Alzheimer's disease 
•This leads to a progressive decrease of learning capacity
•Most Alzheimers disease treatments attempt to 
increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. Nucleus 
basalis of 
MeynertAlzheimers disease:  Mechanism
•Alzheimers disease has been identified as a protein 
misfolding disease, due to the accumulation of 
abnormally folded A-beta proteins 
•A-beta, also written Aβ, is a short peptide that is an 
abnormal proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane 
protein amyloid precursor protein (APP)
•APP gene is on chromosome 21
•The amyloid hypothesis is that these proteins prune 
neuronal connectionsAlzheimer’s disease:  
Microscopic features
•Neuronal loss
•Neuritic (senile) plaques  containing b-amyloid
•Neurofibrillary tangles  composed of phosphorylated 
microtubule associated tau protein
•Cerebral amyloidosisAlzheimers disease gross feature:
Cerebral atrophyOther microscopic Alzheimers 
findings 
•Hirano bodies intracellular aggregates of actin and 
actin-associated proteins are  observed in the neurons
Q1: 73 yo old female presents with progressive memory loss. She 
has taken walks in her neighborhood on several occasions and gets 
lost. After seeing her physician a neuro exam was unremarkable 
except for severe cognitive deficits. Eventuallys she was placed in a 
nursing home where she died. An autopsy was performed on the 
patient and examination of the brain showed bilateral, symmetrical 
atrophy of the frontal lobes with wide sulci. Microscopic 
examination of the brain tissue showed focal collections of neuritic 
processes surrounding central amyloid cores. Which of the listed 
enzymes is responsible for the production of these abnormal 
amyloid cores?
 
A. Adenosine deaminase
B. Alpha-reductase
D. Beta-secretase
C. PROTO oxidase
E. Xanthine oxidaseQ1: 73 yo old female presents with progressive memory loss. She

E. Xanthine oxidaseA little more Tau
•Tau protein is a microtubule protein associated with 
hyperphosphorylation 
•Tau is hypothesized to interfere with neuronal 
transport system
•Many cortical dementias (like Alzheimers) have tau 
protein, and are known as tau-opathiesDementias with Tau
•Frontotemporal
•Pick disease (Lobar atrophy) Discussed later
•Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
•Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)Pick’s disease
•Pick’s disease (one of the frontal temporal dementias)
–causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the 
brain. Symptoms include loss of speech and 
dementia. 
–May be due to mutations in tau on chromosome 17
–Microscopic: build-up of tau proteins in neurons, 
accumulating into silver-staining, spherical 
aggregations known as "Pick bodies“
–Gross: frontal atrophy with “knife edge” gyri Pick disease

Neurodegenerative diseases
Dementia:  
Alzheimer’s disease , Pick’s disease, 
Spongiform encephalopathy: 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Movement Disorders:  
Parkinson’s disease/Multi systems 
atrophy and Huntington’s disease
Motor Disease:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 
Werdnig-Hoffman,  and PoliomyelitisPrion disease (Spongiform 
encephalopathy)
Clinical findings:
•Mental and physical abilities deteriorate and multiple 
holes appear in the cortex causing it to appear like a 
sponge when brain tissue obtained at autopsy
•The main one affecting humans is Creutzfeld-Jakob 
disease
•Personality changes, impaired judgement, gait 
abnormalities, vertigo, 
•Cerebellar and visual abnormalities  may predominate
•Majority die within 6 monthsPrion disease:  Pathogenesis
•Prion protein acts like an infectious agent 
•PrPC   -- produced normally in most cells --amino acid 
sequence is identical to the PrPSC --abnormal protein, the 
difference is in the secondary conformation (B-pleated vs 
alpha helical)
• PrPSC causes post-translational modification of PrPC
•Transmitted by direct inoculation (corneal transplants, 
dural grafts, pituitary products)Prion disease:  Gross and 
microscopic findings
•Gross appearance- -may be normal due to short 
duration of disease
•Microscopic appearance-- vacuolation of neuropil, 
vacuoles are within nerve cell bodies and neuronal 
processes
–cell loss and gliosis may be prominentPrion disease:  Gross and 
microscopic findingsNeurodegenerative diseases

Motor Disease:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,

findings
•Tremor (rest) 
•Rigidity (cogwheel rigidity)
•Bradykinesia (mask-like facies, loss of arm-swing)
•Festinating gait (loss of righting reflexes)
•About 10% of patients develop dementia 
•There is also a separate entity of dementia with 
lewy bodiesParkinson Disease
•Degenerated dopaminergic neurons in substania nigra 
is associated with reduced dopamine (less dopamine= 
more motor dysfunction)
•Alpha synuclein expression (mutation is rare) is the 
causative agent and forms lewy bodies (microscopic 
bodies that are pathognomonic for Parkinson’s)
•Alpha synuclein forms aggregates that are toxic to 
neurons
•LRRK2 mutations are found in the autosomal dominant 
formParkinson’s disease:  Gross and 
microscopic findings
•Gross--loss of pigment  in the substantia nigra
•Microscopic--Lewy bodies (made up of protein alpha 
synuclein) along with pigmented neuronal cell loss and 
gliosis
–Cortical Lewy bodies present in 80% or more of 
casesParkinson’s Disease: Gross and

•Huntington’s disease: (discussed here) 
–Movement disorder (chorea)
–Intellectual decline
–Trinucleotide repeat disease
•Multiple Systems Atrophy ( also called Shy-Drager)
[Not discussed here]

oligodendrocytesHuntington Disease
•AD disease cause by degeneration of strial neurons
•CAG Trinucleotide repeats : Longer repeats earlier onset 
of disease
•Paternal transmission: earlier onset (anticipation)
•No sporadic cases
•Mutant huntington’s protein: huntingtin
Ubiquitin-proteasomes do not break down 
huntingtin as they normally would so IHC to 
ubiquitin can help with the diagnosis 
mHtt Gene for huntingtin located on chromosome 
4p16.3Normal Huntington Disease 
•Gross: atrophy of the caudate nucleus & basal 
ganglia and dilatation of the ventricles

•Amyotrophic  means “not enough tropism (“food”)” 
•Muscle innervated from lateral spinal cord degenerates 
and lateral area hardens  (“ sclerosis”) 
•Progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disease
•Most affected patients die of respiratory compromise and 
pneumonia after 2 to 3 years (some can live longer) 
•Characterized by rapidly progressive motor weakness, 
muscle atrophy and fasciculations, spasticity, dysphagia, 
and respiratory compromise. 
–Sensory function, autonomic and oculomotor activity 
are sparedAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
