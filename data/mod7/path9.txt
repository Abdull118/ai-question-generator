2.Astrocyte: Astrocytoma, glioblastoma
3.Oligodendrocyte:  
Oligodendroglioma
4.Ependymal cell:  Ependymoma

Diffusely infiltrating (not easily

Histologic appearance (grade) 
correlates with overall survival
May become more malignant 
(higher grade) over time 
(especially astrocytomas which 
become glioblastomas)
May spread via CSF
Rarely  metastasizeASTROCYTOMAS
Astrocytes are glial cells are star-
shaped brain cells in the cerebrum.
Astrocytomas do not usually spread 
outside the brain and spinal cord and 
it does not usually affect other 
organs. 
Astrocytomas are the most common 
glioma and can occur in most parts 
of the brain and occasionally in the 
spinal cord.ASTROCYTOMA

Anaplastic (grade 3)
Glioblastoma (grade 4)
Localized (grade 1) (pilocytic)

  -rare multi-system disease that causes 
non-malignant tumors to grow in the 
brain and on other vital organ. 
- symptoms may include seizures, 
developmental delay, behavioral 
problems, skin abnormalities, lung 
and kidney disease. 
-caused by a mutation of either of  
genes, TSC1 and TSC2, that code for 
the proteins hamartin and tuberin 
respectively. 
-These proteins act as tumor growth 
suppressors

giant cell astrocytomaNEUROFIBROMATOSIS
(von Recklinghausen disease) is an AD inherited 
disorder in which the nerve tissue grows 
neurofibromas are benign and may cause serious 
damage by compressing nerves and other tissues. 
The disorder affects Most neural crest cells 
(Schwann cells, melanocytes and endoneurial 
fibroblasts). 
Type 1 (NF1): causes skin changes and deformed 
bones and usually starts at birth. Characterized by 
café au lait spots and/or neurofibromas
Type 2 (NF2): causes hearing loss, ringing in the 
ears and poor balance. It often starts in the teen 
years.
Schwannomatosis: causes intense pain. It is the 
rarest type characterized by multiple schwannomas

Ganglioneuroma  is a tumor of 
the sympathetic nerve fibers 
arising from neural crest cells .[1]
It is classically found in the 
medulla of adrenal glands , but 
may also be found elsewhere
Ganglioneuroma (benign)
Ganglioneuroblastoma 
(intermediate).
Neuroblastoma (aggressive)GN
Treatment
Treatment involves surgery to remove 
the tumor (if it is causing symptoms).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most ganglioneuromas are 
noncancerous. The expected outcome 
is usually good. A ganglioneuroma 
may, however, become cancerous and 
spread to other areas, or it may come 
back after removal.GN

GRADING  AND STAGING  OF BRAIN TUMORS
Staging assesses the spread of cancer 
beyond the origin site. 
Intracrainal cancer does not behave in 
the same way as other cancers.
very rare for primary brain tumors to 
spread outside of the brain, or away 
from CNS
Brain cancer is usually graded rather 
than staged. 
WHO brain tumor grading system 
features four distinct grades Grade I tumor
•Cells look almost normal under a microscope
•Usually associated with long-term survival
•Rare in adults
Grade II tumor•Sometimes spreads to nearby normal tissue and recurs
•Cells look slightly abnormal under a microscope
•Sometimes comes back   as a higher grade tumor
Grade III tumor•Actively reproduces abnormal cells
•Tumor spreads into nearby normal parts of the brain
•Cells look abnormal under a microscope
•Tends to come back, often as a higher grade tumor
Grade IV tumor
•Easily spreads into nearby normal parts of the brain
•Actively reproduces abnormal cells
•Cells look very abnormal under a microscope
•Tumor forms new blood vessels to maintain rapid growth
•Tumors have areas necrosisAJCC (1997) PROGNOSTIC  FACTORS  BRAIN TUMORS
